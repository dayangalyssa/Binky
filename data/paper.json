        "Abstrak": "Fast surface integral equation (SIE) solvers seem to be ideal approaches for simulating 3-D nanophotonic devices, as these devices generate fields both in an interior channel and in the infinite exterior domain. However, many devices of interest, such as optical couplers, have channels that cannot be terminated without generating reflections. Generating absorbers for these channels is a new problem for SIE methods, as the methods were initially developed for problems with finite surfaces. In this thesis, we show that the obvious approach for eliminating reflections, making the channel mildly conductive outside the domain of interest, is inaccurate. We propose a new method in which the absorber has gradually increasing surface conductivity; such an absorber can be easily incorporated in fast integral equation solvers. We present two types of PMCHW-based formulations to incorporate the surface conductivity into the SIE method. The accuracy of the two-type formulations are examined and discussed using an example of the scattering of a Mie sphere with surface conductivities. Moreover, we implement two different FFT-accelerated algorithms for the periodic non-absorbing region and the non-periodic absorbing region. In addition, we use perturbation theory and Poynting's theorem, respectively, to calculate the field decay rate due to the surface conductivity. We show a saturation phenomenon when the electrical surface conductivity is large. However, we show that the saturation is not a problem for the surface absorber since the absorber typically operates in a small surface conductivity regime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the surface conductive absorber by truncating a rectangular waveguide channel. Numerical results show that this new method is orders of magnitude more effective than a volume absorber. We also show that the transition reflection decreases in a power law with increasing the absorber length. We further apply the surface conductive absorber to terminate a waveguide with period-a sinusoidally corrugated sidewalls. We show that a surface absorber that can perform well when the periodic waveguide system is excited with a large group-velocity mode may fail when excited with a smaller group-velocity mode, and give an asymptotic relation between the surface absorber length, transition reflections and group velocity. Numerical results are given to validate the asymptotic prediction.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, we present a complete set of techniques for sub-femtosecond measurement, control and distribution of ultrafast optical pulse trains, with respect to pulse timing and phase. First, analytical analysis of the balanced optical cross-correlator (BOC) for attosecond precision pulse timing measurement is presented for both short and long crystal devices. It is found that the sensitivity of the long crystal BOC is independent of pulse duration, to first order. In addition, analytical noise models predict 13 as rms resolution, within a 1 MHz bandwidth, for optical pulses consistent with a practical fiber optic timing link. This analysis aids the widespread adoption of the BOC technique for other wavelengths and implementations. Secondly, long term timing distribution of a 200 MHz ultrafast optical pulse train over 340 m of single mode optical fiber is demonstrated, using the BOC. In this way, the group delay of the fiber link is directly stabilized with unprecedented precision and longterm stability. In addition, by distributing the entire optical pulse train, all optical and RF harmonics are provided at the remote location for direct synchronization of remote ultrafast lasers and microwave electronics. Over 168 hours of continuous, unaided operation, a drift of 5 fs rms is achieved, with less than 1.5 fs rms drift at timescales up to 10,000 seconds. Additional analysis of factors effecting performance, such as polarization mode dispersion and fiber nonlinearity is studied through experiment and simulations. It is found that nonlinear-origin drifts can be avoided for pulse energies below 40 pJ. A chirped pulse method could be implemented to distribute pulses of higher energy. Thirdly, the first quantum-resolution timing jitter measurement of ultrafast laser timing jitter for passively mode-locked lasers up to the Nyquist frequency is presented. The total jitter from for a 79.4 MHz stretched pulse erbium fiber laser is found to be 2.6 fs rms [10 kHz, 39.7 MHz]. It is found that the timing jitter power spectral density scales with frequency according to that expected for a white noise source, in agreement with theory. However, unexpected spurious jitter at high frequencies can occur for some mode-locked states, adding up to 5.5 fs rms jitter. Similar measurements of a 200 MHz erbium fiber soliton laser reveal the decay time of center frequency fluctuations to be 17 ns, with a predicted excess noise of approximately ten. These measurements suggest that timing jitter can be decreased through improved amplifier design. Finally, the synchronization of a 8 fs fiber supercontinuum at 1200 nm to a 7 fs Ti:Sapphire laser pulse train at 800 nm is achieved for both pulse timing and phase with attosecond precision. This achievement is enabled by the development of a novel scheme for stabilization of the carrier envelope offset of the entire optical bandwidth of an octave spanning supercontinuum, without introducing excess timing jitter. In particular, by implementing an acousto-optic frequency shifting (AOFS) feedback system within a fiber supercontinuum source, carrier envelope phase locking, to the Ti:Sapphire laser, is demonstrated to within 200 mrad rms [100 Hz, 5 MHz]. Previous techniques lack the high-speed, orthogonal control of CEP and pulse timing and broad optical bandwidth for synthesizing few-cycle optical pulses. Furthermore, timing synchronization of 280 as rms is achieved through combined piezoelectric and electro-optic feedback on the fiber supercontinuum, as measured with the BOC. This work enables the synthesis of a frequency comb spanning 650 to 1400 nm, resulting in a 3.5 fs transform limited pulse duration-assuming ideal spectral phase compression. To date, the spectrum has been successfully compressed to 4.7 fs, as measured with two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry (2DSI). Moreover, by stabilizing a fiber supercontinuum source to a low-noise Ti:Sapphire laser, the ultra-high stability of the Ti:Sapphire laser is fully transferred to the octave spanning supercontinuum.",

As a result, the demand for automotive electronics is increasing. Meanwhile, due to strict requirements for demanding specifications, as well as low volume commitment offered by car manufacturers as compared with consumer electronics products, many electronics manufacturers have so far avoided entering this business. However, as the requirement for high technology grow, the technology of the electronics companies becomes indispensable for the car manufacturers. Currently, there are some electronics companies who provide automotive parts, mostly on the components level and not on the solution level, but only few of them are truly successful. The automotive electronics business requires various types of components as well as demanding specifications for safety and operating conditions. Offering solutions for this demanding industry often requires cross-organizational initiative.(cont.) Despite the difficult challenges, many electronics companies, including semiconductor and fabless companies, have already penetrated into this industry, and its market is becoming more and more competitive. The purpose of this work is to discuss the potential of Toshiba Corporation to become a major player in the automotive electronics industry. While it seems to be attractive, there are also many challenges which would face Toshiba as a new player attempting to penetrate this market. The work will focus on the understanding and analysis of these challenges. The work will start from a general description of the current automotive electronics industry. Following, I will discuss the future technological trends of automotive electronic systems and the demands and requirements of the different geographical markets. Following this general background, Toshiba's current market position and a comparison to the key competitors is presented. The work will be concluded with a discussion of the optional strategies which can be adopted by Toshiba if it decides to focus on the automotive market.",

        "Abstrak": "Drug Discovery is a race to be the first to patent a drug that meets a significant medical need in the world. Many pharmaceutical companies are now using automation extensively to improve consistency and aid personnel in testing the millions of potential drug candidates within their labs. Because these machines play an important role in drug discovery, there is significant interest in managing their maintenance. The concern is that downtime is hampering the efforts of drug discovery. This project has sought to reduce that downtime and manage maintenance costs by working with the Technical Operations Group, Novartis' in-house maintenance team. The main objectives have been to devise a better way for evaluating maintenance contracts, improve the availability of the equipment, and instill a culture of continuous improvement in the group. This study shows that maximizing equipment utilization should be a higher priority than reducing downtime. The data show that the high throughput systems are only used an average of three days a week. Reducing downtime, which is most often measured on the scale of minutes, is unlikely to bring about the gains that would be realized by improving capacity utilization. Current metrics and data collection procedures are ineffective for determining automation needs and performance as well as engineer performance. A new system for data collection was implemented along with improvement projects as an introduction to lean principles, with the primary objective being a self-sustaining system of finding process improvements.(cont.) Contracts were evaluated along four criteria: the indispensability of the equipment under contract, the adjusted replacement cost, the level of customization, and the age of equipment. The end results of the internships include a metric gathering system that more closely monitors engineer activity as opposed to equipment activity, completed improvement projects such as the complete overhaul of the tool room including inventory management as well as an automated error log system, and a way of evaluating contracts that will reduce costs without sacrificing performance.",

        "Abstrak": "Ferroelectric materials are key to many modem technologies, in particular piezoelectric actuators and electro-optic modulators. BaTiO₃ is one of the most extensively studied ferroelectric materials. The use of BaTiO₃ for piezoelectric applications is, however, limited due to the small piezoelectric coefficient of the room temperature-stable tetragonal phase. Furthermore, research on BaTiO₃ for integrated optics applications remains sparse. In this work Zr-, Hf-, and KNb- doped BaTiO₃ materials were prepared in a composition range that stabilizes the rhombohedral phase. These materials were prepared as bulk polycrystals using a standard solid-state reaction technique in order to test the piezoelectric and dielectric properties. Some compositions were then chosen for thin film deposition. The films were deposited using pulsed laser deposition on MgO and SOI substrates. Growth orientation, remnant strain and optical properties were then measured. X-ray diffraction was used to confirm the existence of a stable rhombohedral phase. Dielectric measurements confirmed the expected phase transition temperatures. A piezoelectric coefficient of d₃₃=290-470pc/N was measured for Zr- and Hf- doped BaTiO₃, compared with d₃₃=75pC/N for pure BaTiO₃. The electrostrictive coefficient of the KNb-doped material, was measured as Q33=0.37m⁴/C², compared with Q33=0.11m⁴/C² for pure BaTiO₃. The maximum strain measured for the doped samples was 5-10 times higher then that of pure BaTiO₃. The effect of growth conditions on the orientation and strain of BaTiO₃ thin films was studied. As the substrate temperature and laser fluency were increased the film orientation varied from (111) to (110), then to (100). Zr- and Hf- doping helped lower the forming temperature for the(cont.) orientations. The index of refraction for the thin films was measured and a model based on the Clausius-Mossotti relation was used to explain the data. The refractive index for BaTiO₃ films was extracted from the model, giving n=2.334 and n,=2.163.",

        "Abstrak": "In 2007, Dell made the decision to make another attempt at selling computers through the retail channel in an effort to stimulate growth. Dell has been extremely successful in the direct channel and they are now trying to adapt their capabilities and their supply chain so they can meet the challenges and requirements of the new distribution channel. Retailers require large orders on specific dates, they want multiple configurations available to them, they want the most competitive prices, and they want to delay purchase commitments as long as possible. Before 2007, Dell had been manufacturing their notebooks in Dell-owned facilities in Asia. They would then fly the notebooks to the Dell merge center in Nashville, TN before shipping them to the retailer distribution centers. Dell has now begun outsourcing much of the notebook manufacturing to manufacturing partners, or contract manufacturers, in Asia and is continuing to look for other ways to cut costs. One opportunity for significant savings is to switch the method of product transportation from air shipment to ocean shipment. There are a number of issues associated with this option so the change needs to be done correctly or all of the savings could be lost due to other costs such as expedites, excess and obsolescent inventory, and retailer penalties. The difference in lead-time between air and ocean shipment is significant. To evaluate the positive and negative effects of an ocean shipment strategy at Dell I explored two specific cases. The first case analyzed involved notebook orders to Dell's largest customer in the retail channel.(cont.) The main concern regarding ocean shipment in the retail channel is the risk of order cancellation while the finished product is on the water. Therefore, the approach I used was to determine a break-even point and what the cancellation risk would have to be for the costs and benefits to cancel each other out. The second case analyzed involved orders to one of Dell's largest commercial customers. This customer was selected because they typically order a standard configuration and because a finished goods inventory is already maintained by a third party to fulfill their orders. This case allowed me to determine how much additional inventory would have to be maintained due to the increase in lead time. These two scenarios cover a variety of products and channel issues, and have applicable lessons to other customers.",

For many customer service departments, this wrap-up process requires the agent to classify the reason the customer contacted customer service. Typically, this classification is done by assigning a code that describes the reason for a contact. Additionally, if a contact requires a concession, the agent will classify the reason the customer requires a concession, and select an appropriate code. These codes are used by the various business teams within the company to identify and correct failures in their processes. Therefore, these codes should drive down to the root cause for a contact or concession to allow for efficient correction. Possessing codes that do not clearly identify the root cause for a contact are of little or no use for the company. Additionally, the codes must be developed in such a way that they can be accurately chosen by either the agent or the customer. Having agents select the wrong code not only obscures the true cause for a contact, but also creates additional work due to the process involved in determining the correct code. This thesis looks at the challenges inherent in developing a list of codes that both provides clear insight into the root cause for customer contacts, and can be accurately selected by the customer service agent or the customer.",

        "Abstrak": "In recent film boiling heat transfer studies with nanofluids, it was reported that deposition of nanoparticles on a surface significantly increases the nominal minimum heat flux (MHF) or Leidenfrost Point (LFP) temperature, considerably accelerating the transient cooling of overheated objects. It was suggested that the thin nanoparticle deposition layer and the resulting changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the hot surface, such as surface roughness height, wettability and porosity, could greatly affect quenching phenomena. In this study, a set of water-droplet LFP tests are conducted using custom-fabricated surfaces which systemically separate the effects of surface roughness height (0-15 um), wettability (0-83°) and nanoporosity (∼23 nm). In addition, high-speed imaging of the evaporating droplets is used to explore the influence of these surface characteristics on the intermittent solid-liquid contacts in film boiling. The obtained results reveal that nanoporosity (not solely high surface wettability) is the crucial feature in efficiently increasing the LFP temperature by initiating heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles during short-lived solid-liquid contacts, which results in disruption of the vapor film, and that micro-posts on the surface intensify such effects by promoting intermittent liquid-surface contacts.",

        "Abstrak": "We use the composite fermion approach for theoretical studies of the Coulomb drag between two parallel layers of two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime near Landau level filling fraction v = 1/2. Within the composite fermion approach, we use Boltzmann transport theory to determine the polarizability of the composite fermions. While this approach works at filling fraction v = 1/2, a straight-forward expansion of the solution of the Boltzmann equation around v = 1/2 results in spurious divergences that stem from inaccuracies in the expansion at long wavelength. We then attempt to find expressions for the polarizability that are more accurate in this long wavelength limit. The excitation spectrum of the system in the absence of scattering consists of a discrete spectrum of 6 function poles. We introduce tools to deal with such expressions, but we find that we cannot yield any exact results from this approach due to complications in determining the location of poles and the resulting residues.",

        "Abstrak": "Abstract\r\n\r\nHigh fuel flexibility of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) affords the possibility to use relatively cheap, safe, and readily available hydrocarbon (e.g., CH₄) or coal syngas (i.e., CO-H₂ mixtures) fuels. Utilization of such fuels would greatly lower fuel cost and increase the feasibility of SOFC commercialization, especially for near-term adoption in anticipation of the long-awaited so-called “hydrogen economy”. Current SOFC technology has shown good performance with a wide range of hydrocarbon and syngas fuels, but there are still significant challenges for practical application. In this paper, the basic operating principles, state-of-the-art performance benchmarks, and SOFC-relevant materials are summarized. More in-depth reviews on those topics can be found in Kee and co-workers [Combust Sci and Tech 2008; 180:1207–44 and Proc Combust Inst 2005; 30:2379–404] and McIntosh and Gorte [Chem Rev 2004; 104:4845–65]. The focus of this review is on the fundamentals and development of detailed electro- and thermal (or simply, electrothermal) chemistry within the SOFC anode, including electrochemical oxidation mechanisms for H₂, CO, CH₄, and carbon, as well as the effects of carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning. The interdependence of heterogeneous chemistry, charge-transfer processes, and transport are discussed in the context of SOFC membrane-electrode assembly modeling.",

        "Abstrak": "Fast surface integral equation (SIE) solvers seem to be ideal approaches for simulating 3-D nanophotonic devices, as these devices generate fields both in an interior channel and in the infinite exterior domain. However, many devices of interest, such as optical couplers, have channels that cannot be terminated without generating reflections. Generating absorbers for these channels is a new problem for SIE methods, as the methods were initially developed for problems with finite surfaces. In this thesis, we show that the obvious approach for eliminating reflections, making the channel mildly conductive outside the domain of interest, is inaccurate. We propose a new method in which the absorber has gradually increasing surface conductivity; such an absorber can be easily incorporated in fast integral equation solvers. We present two types of PMCHW-based formulations to incorporate the surface conductivity into the SIE method. The accuracy of the two-type formulations are examined and discussed using an example of the scattering of a Mie sphere with surface conductivities. Moreover, we implement two different FFT-accelerated algorithms for the periodic non-absorbing region and the non-periodic absorbing region. In addition, we use perturbation theory and Poynting's theorem, respectively, to calculate the field decay rate due to the surface conductivity. We show a saturation phenomenon when the electrical surface conductivity is large. However, we show that the saturation is not a problem for the surface absorber since the absorber typically operates in a small surface conductivity regime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the surface conductive absorber by truncating a rectangular waveguide channel. Numerical results show that this new method is orders of magnitude more effective than a volume absorber. We also show that the transition reflection decreases in a power law with increasing the absorber length. We further apply the surface conductive absorber to terminate a waveguide with period-a sinusoidally corrugated sidewalls. We show that a surface absorber that can perform well when the periodic waveguide system is excited with a large group-velocity mode may fail when excited with a smaller group-velocity mode, and give an asymptotic relation between the surface absorber length, transition reflections and group velocity. Numerical results are given to validate the asymptotic prediction.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, we present a complete set of techniques for sub-femtosecond measurement, control and distribution of ultrafast optical pulse trains, with respect to pulse timing and phase. First, analytical analysis of the balanced optical cross-correlator (BOC) for attosecond precision pulse timing measurement is presented for both short and long crystal devices. It is found that the sensitivity of the long crystal BOC is independent of pulse duration, to first order. In addition, analytical noise models predict 13 as rms resolution, within a 1 MHz bandwidth, for optical pulses consistent with a practical fiber optic timing link. This analysis aids the widespread adoption of the BOC technique for other wavelengths and implementations. Secondly, long term timing distribution of a 200 MHz ultrafast optical pulse train over 340 m of single mode optical fiber is demonstrated, using the BOC. In this way, the group delay of the fiber link is directly stabilized with unprecedented precision and longterm stability. In addition, by distributing the entire optical pulse train, all optical and RF harmonics are provided at the remote location for direct synchronization of remote ultrafast lasers and microwave electronics. Over 168 hours of continuous, unaided operation, a drift of 5 fs rms is achieved, with less than 1.5 fs rms drift at timescales up to 10,000 seconds. Additional analysis of factors effecting performance, such as polarization mode dispersion and fiber nonlinearity is studied through experiment and simulations. It is found that nonlinear-origin drifts can be avoided for pulse energies below 40 pJ. A chirped pulse method could be implemented to distribute pulses of higher energy. Thirdly, the first quantum-resolution timing jitter measurement of ultrafast laser timing jitter for passively mode-locked lasers up to the Nyquist frequency is presented. The total jitter from for a 79.4 MHz stretched pulse erbium fiber laser is found to be 2.6 fs rms [10 kHz, 39.7 MHz]. It is found that the timing jitter power spectral density scales with frequency according to that expected for a white noise source, in agreement with theory. However, unexpected spurious jitter at high frequencies can occur for some mode-locked states, adding up to 5.5 fs rms jitter. Similar measurements of a 200 MHz erbium fiber soliton laser reveal the decay time of center frequency fluctuations to be 17 ns, with a predicted excess noise of approximately ten. These measurements suggest that timing jitter can be decreased through improved amplifier design. Finally, the synchronization of a 8 fs fiber supercontinuum at 1200 nm to a 7 fs Ti:Sapphire laser pulse train at 800 nm is achieved for both pulse timing and phase with attosecond precision. This achievement is enabled by the development of a novel scheme for stabilization of the carrier envelope offset of the entire optical bandwidth of an octave spanning supercontinuum, without introducing excess timing jitter. In particular, by implementing an acousto-optic frequency shifting (AOFS) feedback system within a fiber supercontinuum source, carrier envelope phase locking, to the Ti:Sapphire laser, is demonstrated to within 200 mrad rms [100 Hz, 5 MHz]. Previous techniques lack the high-speed, orthogonal control of CEP and pulse timing and broad optical bandwidth for synthesizing few-cycle optical pulses. Furthermore, timing synchronization of 280 as rms is achieved through combined piezoelectric and electro-optic feedback on the fiber supercontinuum, as measured with the BOC. This work enables the synthesis of a frequency comb spanning 650 to 1400 nm, resulting in a 3.5 fs transform limited pulse duration-assuming ideal spectral phase compression. To date, the spectrum has been successfully compressed to 4.7 fs, as measured with two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry (2DSI). Moreover, by stabilizing a fiber supercontinuum source to a low-noise Ti:Sapphire laser, the ultra-high stability of the Ti:Sapphire laser is fully transferred to the octave spanning supercontinuum.",

As a result, the demand for automotive electronics is increasing. Meanwhile, due to strict requirements for demanding specifications, as well as low volume commitment offered by car manufacturers as compared with consumer electronics products, many electronics manufacturers have so far avoided entering this business. However, as the requirement for high technology grow, the technology of the electronics companies becomes indispensable for the car manufacturers. Currently, there are some electronics companies who provide automotive parts, mostly on the components level and not on the solution level, but only few of them are truly successful. The automotive electronics business requires various types of components as well as demanding specifications for safety and operating conditions. Offering solutions for this demanding industry often requires cross-organizational initiative.(cont.) Despite the difficult challenges, many electronics companies, including semiconductor and fabless companies, have already penetrated into this industry, and its market is becoming more and more competitive. The purpose of this work is to discuss the potential of Toshiba Corporation to become a major player in the automotive electronics industry. While it seems to be attractive, there are also many challenges which would face Toshiba as a new player attempting to penetrate this market. The work will focus on the understanding and analysis of these challenges. The work will start from a general description of the current automotive electronics industry. Following, I will discuss the future technological trends of automotive electronic systems and the demands and requirements of the different geographical markets. Following this general background, Toshiba's current market position and a comparison to the key competitors is presented. The work will be concluded with a discussion of the optional strategies which can be adopted by Toshiba if it decides to focus on the automotive market.",

Many pharmaceutical companies are now using automation extensively to improve consistency and aid personnel in testing the millions of potential drug candidates within their labs. Because these machines play an important role in drug discovery, there is significant interest in managing their maintenance. The concern is that downtime is hampering the efforts of drug discovery. This project has sought to reduce that downtime and manage maintenance costs by working with the Technical Operations Group, Novartis' in-house maintenance team. The main objectives have been to devise a better way for evaluating maintenance contracts, improve the availability of the equipment, and instill a culture of continuous improvement in the group. This study shows that maximizing equipment utilization should be a higher priority than reducing downtime. The data show that the high throughput systems are only used an average of three days a week. Reducing downtime, which is most often measured on the scale of minutes, is unlikely to bring about the gains that would be realized by improving capacity utilization. Current metrics and data collection procedures are ineffective for determining automation needs and performance as well as engineer performance. A new system for data collection was implemented along with improvement projects as an introduction to lean principles, with the primary objective being a self-sustaining system of finding process improvements.(cont.) Contracts were evaluated along four criteria: the indispensability of the equipment under contract, the adjusted replacement cost, the level of customization, and the age of equipment. The end results of the internships include a metric gathering system that more closely monitors engineer activity as opposed to equipment activity, completed improvement projects such as the complete overhaul of the tool room including inventory management as well as an automated error log system, and a way of evaluating contracts that will reduce costs without sacrificing performance.",

        "Abstrak": "Ferroelectric materials are key to many modem technologies, in particular piezoelectric actuators and electro-optic modulators. BaTiO₃ is one of the most extensively studied ferroelectric materials. The use of BaTiO₃ for piezoelectric applications is, however, limited due to the small piezoelectric coefficient of the room temperature-stable tetragonal phase. Furthermore, research on BaTiO₃ for integrated optics applications remains sparse. In this work Zr-, Hf-, and KNb- doped BaTiO₃ materials were prepared in a composition range that stabilizes the rhombohedral phase. These materials were prepared as bulk polycrystals using a standard solid-state reaction technique in order to test the piezoelectric and dielectric properties. Some compositions were then chosen for thin film deposition. The films were deposited using pulsed laser deposition on MgO and SOI substrates. Growth orientation, remnant strain and optical properties were then measured. X-ray diffraction was used to confirm the existence of a stable rhombohedral phase. Dielectric measurements confirmed the expected phase transition temperatures. A piezoelectric coefficient of d₃₃=290-470pc/N was measured for Zr- and Hf- doped BaTiO₃, compared with d₃₃=75pC/N for pure BaTiO₃. The electrostrictive coefficient of the KNb-doped material, was measured as Q33=0.37m⁴/C², compared with Q33=0.11m⁴/C² for pure BaTiO₃. The maximum strain measured for the doped samples was 5-10 times higher then that of pure BaTiO₃. The effect of growth conditions on the orientation and strain of BaTiO₃ thin films was studied. As the substrate temperature and laser fluency were increased the film orientation varied from (111) to (110), then to (100). Zr- and Hf- doping helped lower the forming temperature for the(cont.) orientations. The index of refraction for the thin films was measured and a model based on the Clausius-Mossotti relation was used to explain the data. The refractive index for BaTiO₃ films was extracted from the model, giving n=2.334 and n,=2.163.",

Dell has been extremely successful in the direct channel and they are now trying to adapt their capabilities and their supply chain so they can meet the challenges and requirements of the new distribution channel. Retailers require large orders on specific dates, they want multiple configurations available to them, they want the most competitive prices, and they want to delay purchase commitments as long as possible. Before 2007, Dell had been manufacturing their notebooks in Dell-owned facilities in Asia. They would then fly the notebooks to the Dell merge center in Nashville, TN before shipping them to the retailer distribution centers. Dell has now begun outsourcing much of the notebook manufacturing to manufacturing partners, or contract manufacturers, in Asia and is continuing to look for other ways to cut costs. One opportunity for significant savings is to switch the method of product transportation from air shipment to ocean shipment. There are a number of issues associated with this option so the change needs to be done correctly or all of the savings could be lost due to other costs such as expedites, excess and obsolescent inventory, and retailer penalties. The difference in lead-time between air and ocean shipment is significant. To evaluate the positive and negative effects of an ocean shipment strategy at Dell I explored two specific cases. The first case analyzed involved notebook orders to Dell's largest customer in the retail channel.(cont.) The main concern regarding ocean shipment in the retail channel is the risk of order cancellation while the finished product is on the water. Therefore, the approach I used was to determine a break-even point and what the cancellation risk would have to be for the costs and benefits to cancel each other out. The second case analyzed involved orders to one of Dell's largest commercial customers. This customer was selected because they typically order a standard configuration and because a finished goods inventory is already maintained by a third party to fulfill their orders. This case allowed me to determine how much additional inventory would have to be maintained due to the increase in lead time. These two scenarios cover a variety of products and channel issues, and have applicable lessons to other customers.",

For many customer service departments, this wrap-up process requires the agent to classify the reason the customer contacted customer service. Typically, this classification is done by assigning a code that describes the reason for a contact. Additionally, if a contact requires a concession, the agent will classify the reason the customer requires a concession, and select an appropriate code. These codes are used by the various business teams within the company to identify and correct failures in their processes. Therefore, these codes should drive down to the root cause for a contact or concession to allow for efficient correction. Possessing codes that do not clearly identify the root cause for a contact are of little or no use for the company. Additionally, the codes must be developed in such a way that they can be accurately chosen by either the agent or the customer. Having agents select the wrong code not only obscures the true cause for a contact, but also creates additional work due to the process involved in determining the correct code. This thesis looks at the challenges inherent in developing a list of codes that both provides clear insight into the root cause for customer contacts, and can be accurately selected by the customer service agent or the customer.",

They pay for lodging and spend as much on retail purchases as on lodging or food. Domestic Chinese business is the main driver of business travel in China The major drivers of tourism growth in China are: the rise of the middle class, expansion of business and trade, government policy, public infrastructure, private industry, Cooperative Tourism Zones, mega-events and conventions, and increased leisure time.",

        "Abstrak": "In recent film boiling heat transfer studies with nanofluids, it was reported that deposition of nanoparticles on a surface significantly increases the nominal minimum heat flux (MHF) or Leidenfrost Point (LFP) temperature, considerably accelerating the transient cooling of overheated objects. It was suggested that the thin nanoparticle deposition layer and the resulting changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the hot surface, such as surface roughness height, wettability and porosity, could greatly affect quenching phenomena. In this study, a set of water-droplet LFP tests are conducted using custom-fabricated surfaces which systemically separate the effects of surface roughness height (0-15 um), wettability (0-83°) and nanoporosity (∼23 nm). In addition, high-speed imaging of the evaporating droplets is used to explore the influence of these surface characteristics on the intermittent solid-liquid contacts in film boiling. The obtained results reveal that nanoporosity (not solely high surface wettability) is the crucial feature in efficiently increasing the LFP temperature by initiating heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles during short-lived solid-liquid contacts, which results in disruption of the vapor film, and that micro-posts on the surface intensify such effects by promoting intermittent liquid-surface contacts.",

In plasmas with the temperature ratio T[subscript e]/T[subscript i]=100, it is found that a single grain's oscillatory wake disappears for flow Mach numbers M less than approximately 0.3, which is the parameter regime where Landau damping is expected to be strong. Neutral collisions suppress potential oscillations above M=0.3, but not the trailing attractive potential peak caused by ion focusing. The transverse (grain-aligning) force on a downstream particle in the wake of another is obtained rigorously from the code in three-dimensional simulations. It shows general agreement with the force that would be deduced from the single-grain wake potential gradient. Except for relatively large grains in the nonlinear collisional regime, the grain-aligning force is very small for slow flow.",

Within the composite fermion approach, we use Boltzmann transport theory to determine the polarizability of the composite fermions. While this approach works at filling fraction v = 1/2, a straight-forward expansion of the solution of the Boltzmann equation around v = 1/2 results in spurious divergences that stem from inaccuracies in the expansion at long wavelength. We then attempt to find expressions for the polarizability that are more accurate in this long wavelength limit. The excitation spectrum of the system in the absence of scattering consists of a discrete spectrum of 6 function poles. We introduce tools to deal with such expressions, but we find that we cannot yield any exact results from this approach due to complications in determining the location of poles and the resulting residues.",

Utilization of such fuels would greatly lower fuel cost and increase the feasibility of SOFC commercialization, especially for near-term adoption in anticipation of the long-awaited so-called “hydrogen economy”. Current SOFC technology has shown good performance with a wide range of hydrocarbon and syngas fuels, but there are still significant challenges for practical application. In this paper, the basic operating principles, state-of-the-art performance benchmarks, and SOFC-relevant materials are summarized. More in-depth reviews on those topics can be found in Kee and co-workers [Combust Sci and Tech 2008; 180:1207–44 and Proc Combust Inst 2005; 30:2379–404] and McIntosh and Gorte [Chem Rev 2004; 104:4845–65]. The focus of this review is on the fundamentals and development of detailed electro- and thermal (or simply, electrothermal) chemistry within the SOFC anode, including electrochemical oxidation mechanisms for H₂, CO, CH₄, and carbon, as well as the effects of carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning. The interdependence of heterogeneous chemistry, charge-transfer processes, and transport are discussed in the context of SOFC membrane-electrode assembly modeling.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis examines the historical conditions that have contributed to high rates of vaccine innovation in the U.S. during the twentieth century. Empirical analysis of vaccine license data demonstrates that the highest rates of innovation were achieved during the 1940's. Historical analysis of this data indicates that a large percentage of these innovations were the product of World War II vaccine development programs. Participation in these programs fostered a uniquely productive culture of collaboration between military and industrial vaccine developers that persisted through the postwar era, maintaining innovation rates through the 1960's and early 1970's. By the mid-1970's, however, the historical circumstances and cultural factors that engendered and sustained military-industrial collaboration began to change, causing rates of vaccine innovation to fall and vaccine stocks to dwindle. Poor economic incentives for vaccine development are often cited as the reason for falling rates of innovation. This explanation is correct but incomplete, because, for example, economic incentives for vaccine development were poor during the 1940's and 1950's, when innovation rates were high. I demonstrate that vaccine innovation is tied to levels of military-industrial collaboration and that declining rates of innovation in recent decades are associated with the disruption of this military-industrial culture of collaboration. Finally, drawing on lessons from this history of military-industrial relations, I examine the opportunities and challenges that the new \"war on terrorism\" presents for efforts to improve vaccine innovation and supplies.",

This can be due to a lack of electricity, high cost, and other economical constraints. For these reasons, a successful, chronic wound treatment, known as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), has not been readily used, although many patients would benefit. Aiming to expand this therapy, the viability of inexpensive, purely mechanical simplified negative pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) systems is explored in this thesis. Air leaks into the NPWT system are identified as the limiting factor for the possibility of sNPWT. An air leak detection system, along with proper dressing techniques, is defined. Once sNPWT is proven to be viable, it is developed further, based on customer needs in the targeted markets and sNPWT functional parameters. Three vacuum pump embodiments are prototyped and analyzed for possible implementation: bellows pumps, bladder pumps, and rolling diaphragm pumps. The bellows pump is chosen for the final design, and is analyzed in preparation for manufacture. Once manufactured, the bellows pump will be used in clinical trials at the Shriners Bum Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, under the guidance of Dr. Robert Sheridan.",

The turbine needed to convert a suitable amount of energy without interfering with the buoy's overall survivability or mission readiness. The turbine was a Babinsten impulse bi-directional turbine which used sea water as the working fluid. Testing was conducted in a recirculating water tunnel, and two flow visualization techniques were applied. This was the first project in the MIT water tunnel since a major renovation and upgrade., and thus included a large amount of equipment set up and performance analysis. The turbine utilized a Venturi shaped shroud, with a maximum diameter of 25.4 cm contracting down to 10.0 cm diameter where the blades were located. Ultimately PIV images revealed that the Venturi shroud was creating a large stagnation region at, the turbine inlet. This stagnation region choked off flow through the turbine, resulting in poor power production. Subsequent testing revealed that the shroud without the turbine blades also produced a large stagnation region. casting doubt on the concept of Venturi shrouded turbines in general. The device failed to meet the requirements for the WHOI buoy and was not a suitable solution for converting the buoy to energy self sufficiency.",

This thesis seeks to answer two main questions: What events and conditions are likely to increase the project's uncertainty during the formulation of the design requirements? And, in what way can the effects of these events and conditions be avoided or mitigated? Using the information gathered through an extensive literature review, a descriptive framework was compiled. The information used was validated following two different paths: first, the evolution of the set of design requirements of several teams in a product design and development class was analyzed and, second, veterans of industry were interviewed about their experiences during the development process.",

Preliminary analysis identified improvement opportunities at evaluation of supplier's capability, agreement on requirements with suppliers at early supplier selection stage as well as closed loop supplier management. A 4-step sequential process was designed to improve the supplier selection and management process. First, an initial supplier capability assessment process is incorporated in the quotation process and the Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to make an integrated supplier selection decision. Second, a production part approval process ensures that the supplier fully understands the requirements and proves whether or not it can meet the requirements consistently. Third, a formal inspection report acceptance process for the new product is established to utilize the supplier's inspection resource. Fourth, a formal supplier corrective request process for nonconformance is suggested to provide corrective feedback to the supplier in addition to instructions for improvement. The overall new supplier selection and management process is expected to benefit both Waters and the suppliers. The suggested process is expected to have more visibility to the supplier's capability and improve the supplier quality. The non-value added activities such as incoming inspection rejections and the related disposition process are to be reduced and thus cost saving can be achieved.",

Detailed time studies were then performed on the assembly and test processes, to establish baseline measurements and to gather in-depth information on the value added and non-value added activities. It was found that 18% of the assembly activities were non-value added activities, 28% of which were related to material handling on the production floor. Based on the analysis a new kit design and kitting process were developed, which enabled parts to arrive from the warehouse in kits specific to each assembly procedure performed on the module. A method of indicating shortages was also proposed. The new design and process also facilitated Just-in-Time ordering and arrival of parts. The new kitting process was piloted, and based on two trial runs it was found that it reduced material handling time on the production floor by 70% and overall time spent on non-value added assembly operations was reduced by 20%.",

When programs such as Medicare and Medicaid were introduced in the 1960s, the government directly reimbursed medical providers for the care that they provided, through a classic \"single payer system.\" Since the mid-1980s, however, there has been an evolution towards a model where the government subsidizes enrollees who choose among privately provided insurance options. In the United States, privatized delivery of public health insurance appears to be here to stay, with debates now focused on how much to expand its reach. Yet such privatized delivery raises a variety of thorny issues. Will choice among private insurance options lead to adverse selection and market failures in privatized insurance markets? Can individuals choose appropriately over a wide range of expensive and confusing plan options? Will a privatized approach deliver the promised increases in delivery efficiency claimed by advocates? What policy mechanisms have been used, or might be used, to address these issues? A growing literature in health economics has begun to make headway on these questions.

This two-component system was then studied in the presence of a magnetic field gradient and an optical lattice. The presence of a magnetic field gradient separated the atoms into regions of opposite spin, with a boundary region of mixed spin in the center. In the presence of an optical lattice, the width of this region was found to be proportional to the system's temperature and inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. This allowed the measurement of the size of the boundary region to act as a thermometer for the system, representing the first demonstration of spin gradient thermometry. This thermometer represents the first practical method for thermometry in the Mott insulator, and has features of high dynamic range and tunable sensitivity. Given sufficient optical resolution and control over the magnetic field gradient, the lower limit of this thermometer is set by quantum magnetic ordering effects. The dynamic response of this system to changes in magnetic field gradient was studied, both in the weak and strong lattice regimes. The result of these studies was the development of spin gradient demagnetization cooling. By performing an adiabatic drop in gradient strength while still in the superfluid, significant cooling of the entire system was observed. When the same process was performed in the Mott insulator, the spin temperature was cooled dramatically, while remaining out of equilibrium with the remaining degrees of freedom of the system. By reversing the gradient direction, inverted spin populations with negative temperatures have been produced. Spin gradient demagnetization has produced the closest approach to absolute zero yet recorded: 300 pK for the equilibrated system, and spin temperatures of 75 pK as well as -75 pK. The ability to achieve these temperatures puts studies of quantum magnetism in optical lattices within reach.",

We compute the nucleon vector and axial vector form factors as well as the generalized form factors, and analyze the nucleon charge, magnetization, and axial radii, anomalous magnetic moment, and axial charge. In addition, we compute quark contributions to the nucleon momentum and spin. Our calculation is novel for three reasons. It is a first full QCD calculation using both sea and valence chiral quarks with pion masses as low as m[pi] = 300 MeV. We develop a method to keep systematic effects in the lattice nucleon matrix elements under control, which helps us to obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio, to achieve higher precision and to test the applicability of low-energy effective theories. Finally, we compare the results from lattice QCD calculations with two different discretization methods and lattice spacings, with the rest of the calculation technique kept equal. The level of agreement between these results indicates that our calculations are not significantly affected by discretization effects.",

        "Abstrak": "The interaction between a probe and a plasma has been studied since the 1920s and the pioneering work of Mott-Smith and Langmuir [1], and is still today an active topic of experimental and theoretical research. Indeed an understanding of the current collection process by an electrode is relevant to diverse matters such as Langmuir and Mach-probes calibrations, dusty plasma physics, or spacecraft charging. Recent simulations relying on the ad hoc designed code SCEPTIC have fully addressed the collisionless and unmagnetized problem for a drifting collector idealized as a sphere. SCEPTIC is a 2d/3v hybrid Particle In Cell (PIC) code, in which the ion motion is fully resolved, while the electrons are treated as a Boltzmann distributed fluid [2, 3]. In the present work we tackle the transition between the unmagnetized and the weakly magnetized regime of ion collection by a spherical probe (The mean ion Larmor radius rL > rp) in a collisionless plasma (The ion mean free path Am,fp > rp). When the sphere is at space potential, we demonstrate that the ion current dependence on the background magnetic field B is linear for low B, and provide analytical expressions for this dependence. When the probe potential can not be neglected, the problem shows two distinct scale lengths: A collisionless layer of a few rp close to the probe, followed by a collisional presheath of a few AX,fp. The chosen approach is to resolve the collisionless scale-length with SCEPTIC, while using appropriate outer boundary conditions on the potential and ion distribution function to connect with the unresolved collisional presheath. We present results of our numerical simulations for a wide range of plasma parameters of direct relevance to Langmuir and Mach-probes.",

        "Abstrak": "(cont.) Investigated in this thesis are the excitation and observation of Langmuir wave turbulence caused by the parametric decay instability (PDI) in high-frequency space plasma heating experiments conducted at the NSF/DoD High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility in Gakona, Alaska during the spring and summer of 2006. The PDI is the decay of an electromagnetic (EM) wave into an electron plasma wave (i.e., Langmuir wave) and an ion acoustic wave. When the excited Langmuir wave parametrically decays into another Langmuir and ion acoustic wave pair, a cascade of Langmuir waves can occur provided that the instability threshold is satisfied. According to recently advanced theory by Kuo and Lee [2005], there are two possible methods of cascade: non-resonant and resonant. While the non-resonant cascade proceeds at the location of excitation, the resonant process occurs at lower altitudes to minimize losses that the non-resonant process incurs by remaining at the excitation altitude. Such losses are caused by the frequency mismatch effect, as the decay ion acoustic wave frequency becomes much less than that of the normal ion acoustic waves. In their downward propagation the Langmuir waves in the resonant cascade suffer from propagation losses, however these losses are less than those associated with the non-resonant process. The resonant process is therefore expected to have a lower threshold. Theoretical claims and calculations are compared to observations made at Arecibo, Puerto Rico and Tromso, Norway. Claims are also are supported by incoherent backscatter radar observations made at the HAARP facility in Gakona.",

        "Abstrak": "An evolutionary BWR fuel assembly design was studied as a means to increase the power density of current and future BWR cores. The new assembly concept is based on replacing four traditional assemblies and large water gap regions with a single large assembly. The traditional BWR cylindrical UO2-fuelled Zr-clad fuel pin design is retained, but the pins are arranged on a 22x22 square lattice. There are 384 fuel pins with 9.6 mm diameter within a large assembly. Twenty-five water rods with 27 mm diameter maintain the moderating power and accommodate as many finger-type control rods. The total number and positions of the control rod drive mechanisms are not changed, so existing BWRs can be retrofitted with the new fuel assembly. The technical characteristics of the large fuel assembly were evaluated through a systematic comparison with a traditional 9x9 fuel assembly. The pressure, inlet subcooling and average exit quality of the new core were kept equal to the reference values. Thus the power uprate is accommodated by an increase of the core mass flow rate. The findings are as follows: - VIPRE subchannel analysis suggests that, due to its higher fuel to coolant heat transfer area and coolant flow area, the large assembly can operate at a power density 20% higher than the traditional assembly while maintaining the same margin to dryout. - CASMO 2D neutronic analysis indicates that the large assembly can sustain an 18-month irradiation cycle (at uprated power) with 3-batch refueling, <5wt% enrichment with <60 MWD/kg average discharge burnup. Also, the void and fuel temperature reactivity coefficients are both negative and close to those of the traditional BWR core. - The susceptibility of the large assembly core to thermalhydraulic/neutronic oscillations of the density-wave type was explored with an in-house code.(cont.) It was found that, while well within regulatory limits, the flow oscillation decay ratio of the large assembly core is higher than that of the traditional assembly core. The higher core wide decay ratio of the large assembly core is due to its somewhat higher (more negative) void reactivity coefficient. The pressure drop in the uprated core is 17 %Vo higher than in the reference core, and the flow is 20% higher; therefore, larger pumps will be needed. FRAPCON analysis suggests that the thermo-mechanical performance (e.g., fuel temperature, fission gas release, hoop stress and strain, clad oxidation) of the fuel pins in the large assembly is similar to that of the reference assembly fuel pins. A conceptual mechanical design of the large fuel assembly and its supporting structure was developed. It was found that the water rods and lower tie plate can be used as the main structural element of the assembly, with horizontal support being provided by the top fuel guide plate and core plate assembly, and vertical support being provided by the fuel support duct, which also supports the finger-type control rods.",

The system was modeled using RELAP5-3D. The uncertainties in input parameters were assessed and were propagated through the model using Latin Hypercube Sampling. An important finding was the discovery that the smaller pressure loss through the DHR heat exchanger than through the core would make the flow to bypass the core through one DHR loop, if two loops operated in parallel. This finding is a warning against modeling only one lumped DHR loop and assuming that n of them will remove n times the decay power. Sensitivity analyses revealed that there are values of some input parameters for which failures are very unlikely. The calculated conditional (i.e., given the LOCA) failure probability was deemed to be too high leading to the identification of several design changes to improve system reliability. This study is an example of the kinds of insights that can be obtained by including a reliability assessment in the design process. It is different from the usual use of PSA in design, which compares different system configurations, because it focuses on the thermal-hydraulic performance of a safety function.",

        "Abstrak": "Kinetochores bind to microtubules and are responsible for chromosome segregation and the accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division. Kinetochores are DNA-protein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA sequences. In budding yeast, the kinetochores consist of approximately fifty proteins that are organized into a large multi-subunit complex. Multiple kinetochore proteins are thought to work together in establishing, sensing and maintaining the microtubule attachment. Following attachment, kinetochores act to couple microtubule force generation to chromosome movements. Microtubule associated proteins are also thought to play a key role in this process by regulating plus-end microtubule dynamics and tensile force generation. However, the actual molecular mechanism of force generation is unclear. We have used a combination of live-cell imaging, biochemical and genetic techniques in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, to identify ten kinetochore subunits and elucidate their roles in microtubule attachment. Among these proteins are microtubule binding proteins and a molecular motor with homologues in animal cells. By analyzing the changes in chromosome positioning and dynamics in various kinetochore mutants, we show that different kinetochore proteins are required for the imposition of tension on paired sister kinetochores and for correct chromosome motion throughout the cell cycle. Utilizing 3D comparative motion analysis of the chromosomes has revealed that kinetochore proteins essential for microtubule attachment in early S-phase are not required at other points in the cell cycle. Our results suggest that different subsets of kinetochore proteins regulate the dynamic nature of microtubule growth and shrinkage for the generation of mechanical force and proper chromosome segregation.",

        "Abstrak": "Random matrix theory is a maturing discipline with decades of research in multiple fields now beginning to converge. Experience has shown that many exact formulas are available for certain matrices with real, complex, or quaternion entries. In random matrix jargon, these are the cases β = 1, 2 and 4 respectively. This thesis explores the general P > 0 case mathematically and with symbolic software. We focus on generalizations of the Hermite distributions originating in physics (the \"Gaussian\" ensembles) and the Laguerre distributions of statistics (the \"Wishart\" matrices). One of our main contributions is the construction of tridiagonal matrix models for the general (β > 0) 0 β-Hermite and (β > 0, a > β(m - 1)/2) β-Laguerre ensembles of parameter a and size m, and investigate applications of these new ensembles, particularly in the areas of eigenvalue statistics. The new models are symmetric tridiagonal, and with entries from real distributions, regardless of the value of β. The entry distributions are either normal or X, so \"classical\", and the independence pattern is maximal, in the sense that the only constraints arise from the symmetric/semi-definite condition. The β-ensemble distributions have been studied for the particular 1, 2, 4 values of p as joint eigenvalue densities for full random matrix ensembles (Gaussian, or Hermite, and Wishart, or Laguerre) with real, complex, and quaternion entries (for references, see [66] and [70]). In addition, general -ensembles were considered and studied as theoretical distributions ([8, 51, 50, 55, 56]), with applications in lattice gas theory and statistical mechanics (the parameter being interpreted as an arbitrary inverse temperature of a Coulomb gas with logarithmic potential).(cont.) Certain eigenvalue statistics over these general β-ensembles, namely those expressible in terms of integrals of symmetric polynomials with corresponding Hermite or Laguerre weights, can be computed in terms of multivariate orthogonal polynomials (Hermite or Laguerre). We have written a Maple Library (MOPs: Multivariate Orthogonal Polynomials symbolically) which implements some new and some known algorithms for computing the Jack, Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi multivariate polynomials for arbitrary. This library can be used as a tool for conjecture-formulation and testing, for statistical computations, or simply for getting acquainted with the mathematical concepts. Some of the figures in this thesis have been obtained using MOPs. Using the new β-ensemble models, we have been able to provide a unified perspective of the previously isolated 1, 2, and 4 cases, and prove generalizations for some of the known eigenvalue statistics to arbitrary β. We have rediscovered (in the Hermite case) a strong version of the Wigner Law (semi-circle), and proved (in the Laguerre case) a strong version of the similar law (generalized quarter-circle). We have obtained first-order perturbation theory for the P large case, and we have reason to believe that the tridiagonal models in the large n (ensemble size) limit will also provide a link between the largest eigenvalue distributions for both Hermite and Laguerre for arbitrary P (for β = 1, 2, this link was proved to exist by Johannson [52] and Johnstone [53]) ...",

During growth on a non-preferred nitrogen source or during nitrogen starvation, Gaplp is sorted to the plasma membrane, where it is active and can transport amino acids into the cell. During growth on a preferred or intermediate nitrogen source, Gap p is sorted to the vacuole and degraded. To better understand the signals governing Gaplp sorting, we isolated mutants with defects in Gaplp sorting during growth on a non-preferred nitrogen source. We found that genes that regulate the glutamate and glutamine biosynthesis pathways have a pronounced effect on the intracellular sorting of Gaplp. Mutations in the genes encoding the principal enzymes for glutamate and glutamine synthesis, GDH1 and GLN1, decreased intracellular levels of glutamate and glutamine, respectively, and increased delivery of Gap Ip to the plasma membrane. In contrast, deletion of the MKS] gene, which encodes a negative regulator of glutamate synthesis, increased glutamate and glutamine levels and increased sorting of Gaplp to the vacuole. We also found that the LST8 gene, which was previously implicated in the regulation of Gap lp sorting, encodes a positively-acting component of the TOR signaling pathway. Because the TOR pathway inhibits glutamate and glutamine biosynthesis, lst8 mutants accumulated high levels of these amino acids and showed increased Gaplp sorting to the vacuole. Likewise, wild-type cells grown with a sublethal concentration of rapamycin showed increased glutamate and glutamine levels and increased Gaplp sorting to the vacuole.(cont.) Glutamate and glutamine were not unusual in their ability to affect Gaplp sorting, since all natural amino acids and many amino acid analogs, regardless of their utility as nitrogen sources, also triggered sorting of Gaplp to the vacuole. Finally, we found that many individual amino acids were toxic to mutants that sorted Gaplp constitutively to the plasma membrane. Together, these results indicate that amino acids are a signal for sorting Gaplp to the vacuole and suggest that the sensitivity of Gaplp sorting to amino acids represents a mechanism to protect yeast from an intracellular amino acid imbalance.",

        "Abstrak": "E. coli ClpX is a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family of ATPases that remodel multi-component complexes and facilitate ATP-dependent protein degradation. Protein remodelers alter the biological activity of their substrates, typically by changing the quaternary structure of their target proteins. ClpX remodels protein-DNA complexes, termed transpososomes, made during recombination of the phage Mu. When recombination is complete, the core four-subunit transpososome complex does not spontaneously release the DNA; transposase remains so stably bound that subsequent replication of the Mu genome is inhibited. To understand how ClpX releases the replication block without destroying the transpososomes, we characterized the mechanism and products of transpososome remodeling. To better understand the mechanism ClpX uses to facilitate remodeling, I first participated in a collaborative project that defined major biochemical reaction steps involved in protein degradation by ClpX and its associated peptidase ClpP. These experiments demonstrated that ClpX acts as a powerful unfolding enzyme during degradation reactions. Then, I asked whether this same unfolding activity was also responsible for transpososome remodeling. These experiments demonstrated that ClpX can unfold transposase monomers, and that it exerts a conformational change in transposase subunits during remodeling. However, only subunits directly contacted by ClpX undergo a conformational change. Analysis of the minimal interaction necessary between ClpX and the complex revealed that recognition of one subunit in the complex is sufficient for remodeling.(cont.) These results establish that the unfolding activity of ClpX is sufficient to explain its role in both complex destabilization and proteolysis. To understand how ClpX could use such a destructive activity for a non-destructive process, I characterized the products of the remodeling reaction by following the fate of both the protein subunits and the Mu DNA. Whereas some subunits remain associated with the recombined DNA, release of a subset of subunits accompanies remodeling. The products of remodeling were unchanged even when a degradation-specific signal was placed on the transposase or when another unfolding enzyme was used for the reaction. Thus, we propose that physical properties of the target complex direct the configuration of the remodeled products. This work provides a model for how unfolding enzymes can alter biological complexes in a non-destructive manner.",

Mark-recapture methods can be used to estimate transition probabilities among life-stages from capture histories of marked individuals for which stages can be determined at each sampling occasion. This method is called a multi-stage mark-recapture (MSMR) method. In this thesis, I describe advances I made in the MSMR method and present analyses that apply this method to actual data. The advances I made in the MSMR method are motivated by a need to provide a link between mark-recapture data and demographic models such as matrix population models and integrodifference models. I resolve some issues that are commonly encountered during sampling, such as the fact that the sex or life-stage of some individuals is unknown during some sampling occasions and that individuals become unobservable during some life-stages. I introduce a stage-structure that permits simple conversion of estimated transition probabilities into a matrix population model. I describe an algorithm to simplify programming for parameter estimation. I also introduce a method to estimate the distribution of dispersal displacements (a dispersal kernel) from mark-recapture data. I apply some of the methods described above to data of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The right whales are considered one of the most endangered mammals. The current population size is about 300 in the northwestern Atlantic, and the number is declining. I applied the multi-stage mark-recapture statistics to the 17-year in- dividual sighting history data.(cont.) Using the estimated transition probabilities, I constructed a population projection matrix, which was used for further demographic analyses. I found that the population was slowly increasing in 1980, but it started to decline slowly around 1992. I show that (1) this change was caused by increased mortality of females that have just given birth, (2) protecting two females a year from the deaths is enough to prevent the declining trend, and (3) demographic stochasticity is a more important factor influencing their long-term viability than environmental stochasticity.",

These abnormalities may result from a defect in replication restart at damaged or stalled replication forks. Thus, whereas dnaBS3 71P suppresses the defects of mutant cells that cannot initiate or restart replication, expressing DnaBS371P in wild-type cells causes defects in initiation and restart.DnaB and DnaD are essential proteins that function in the initiation and control of DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis. I found that DnaB and DnaD are required to load the replicative helicase onto chromosomal origins during replication initiation. DnaB and DnaD are also involved in loading helicase during replication restart at sites of stalled replication forks. Despite the fact that DnaB and DnaD are thought to work together to load helicase, DnaB and DnaD are found in separate subcellular compartments. I showed that DnaB is found in the membrane fraction of cells, and DnaD is found in the cytoplasmic fraction. This separation could prevent helicase loading during the majority of the cell cycle. I isolated a missense mutation in dnaB, dnaBS371P, that disrupts the spatial separation of DnaB and DnaD. I isolated dnaBS371P as a suppressor of the temperature sensitivity of dnaBts cells and dnaDts cells. dnaBS3 71P also suppresses the growth defects of ipriA cells, which cannot restart replication at stalled forks. I found that a significant fraction of DnaD is found in the membrane fraction of dnaBS371P cells. In addition, I observed a direct interaction between DnaBS371P and DnaD that is not observed between the wild-type proteins. I hypothesize that the DnaB-DnaD interaction is regulated, thereby controlling when these two proteins converge at the membrane to coordinate helicase loading. dnaBS3 71P cells lack proper control of replication, suggesting that the spatial separation of DnaB and DnaD is an important mechanism of replication control in B. subtilis. I showed that dnaBS371P cells over-initiate replication when grown slowly in minimal medium, but contain decreased DNA content when grown faster, in rich medium.",

        "Abstrak": "Metastasis, or the spread of a primary tumor to distal sites in the body, is the major cause of human cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Metastasis requires a complex series of cellular events that remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Recently, advances in microarray technology have allowed cancer biologists to globally survey metastatic progression and define patterns of gene expression that correlate with progression to a metastatic phenotype. By using such a genomic approach, our laboratory identified a subset of genes that regulate the actin cytoskeleton whose enhanced expression correlates with metastasis. This thesis describes the characterization of IQGAP1, a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, as a potentially critical player in metastatic progression. Here I show a strong positive correlation between IQGAP1 expression levels and metastatic progression in both in vivo-selected human metastatic melanoma cells and other human tumors. In addition, I have experimentally analyzed the role of IQGAP1 in metastasis using two different dominant-negative mutants. The results suggest that IQGAP1 may play a functional role in metastatic progression, particularly in the processes of cell migration and invasion. This work lays a scientific framework by which cancer biologists can look at global gene expression analyses and then probe deeper into individual genes to define the molecular mechanisms underlying their roles. In addition, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of metastasis, and identifies in IQGAP 1 a potential molecular target for future tumor metastasis therapies.",

Just as Brownian motion is a scaling limit of discrete random walks, these objects serve as universal scaling limits of functions or paths associated with the underlying discrete models. We establish a new convergence result for percolation, a well-studied discrete model. We also study random sets of points surrounded by exceptional numbers of conformal loop ensemble loops and establish the existence of a random generalized function describing the nesting of the conformal loop ensemble. Using this framework, we study the relationship between Gaussian free field extrema and nesting extrema of the ensemble of Gaussian free field level loops. Finally, we describe a coupling between the set of all Gaussian free field level loops and a conformal loop ensemble growth process introduced by Werner and Wu. We prove that the dynamics are determined by the conformal loop ensemble in this coupling, and we use this result to construct a conformally invariant metric space.",

        "Abstrak": "The characterization of the volume targeting capabilities of a telerobotic device capable of needle distal tip manipulation with a pre-curved needle is the focus of this thesis. The concept of deploying a pre-curved stylet from a concentric stiff cannula that is capable of both translational and rotational motions allows the device to achieve targeting of volumes through a single needle insertion into a soft medium. Each mechanism component was analyzed for its motion, and separate functional requirements were determined for experiments to characterize its accuracy and repeatability. Three main areas of mechanical studies were selected for experimentation: (1) accuracy and repeatability of the robot drive mechanisms; (2) 3D experiments measured the positional accuracies of the device in being able to command the cannula or stylet tips to travel to the desired location input into the control box; (3) 2D experiments in body tissue simulating ballistics gelatin analyzed the accuracy and repeatability of the device in being able to target a small volume inside simulated surgical environments in one plane, as well as the potential effects the gelatin may have had on the stylets' travel paths. Each set of experimental protocols and setup were specifically designed to target the characterization of that mechanism or component of the device. A kinematic model was used as a basis of comparison for the two latter experiments. The robot drive mechanism has a fundamental driving repeatability of 0.209mm in cannula axial translation, 0.034mm in stylet axial translation and 0.2200 in cannula rotation. For the 0.838mm diameter 30mm radius of curvature stylet, the stylet has an actual radius of curvature of 31.72mm as determined through a scan measurement. The tip positions experiments in the CMM and gel yielded radii of curvature changes of - 1.461mm or -4.606% between the CMM data and the actual measured stylet, and +1.202mm or +3.789% between the gel data and the stylet. 2D volume targeting experiments yielded an average distance of 1.8822mm + 0.2628mm between the measured stylet tip positions and the model based calculated positions. The stylet with the highest targeting accuracy and repeatability was the 0.838mm diameter 20mm radius of curvature stylet with a targeting accuracy of 1.2760mm ± 0.7256mm, making it the ideal stylet for use in volume targeting procedures.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis provides an overview of geothermal power generation and the potential for geothermal energy utilization in China. Geothermal energy is thermal energy stored in the earth's crust and currently the only ubiquitously available form of renewable energy that does not require a fuel or present intermittency concerns when used for power generation. In China, geothermal fields were first studied in the 1970s, but commercial development for power generation has been limited to 25MW, which is insignificant when compared to 1978MW of geothermal power plant capacity in the neighboring and much smaller Philippines. The barriers to geothermal development in China are common and can be narrowed down to uncertainties in commercial viability, lack of technical knowledge, and poor oversight of geothermal projects. This thesis finds several ways in which the federal and local Chinese government can encourage the development of geothermal energy. In light of increasing CO2 emissions and its effects on climate change, the development of renewable energy such as geothermal energy remains critical.",

Eighty subjects were interviewed and rated the attractiveness, functionality, and an unrelated factor (weight) before and after using a salt shaker. Eight different salt shakers were used, that varied in attractiveness and functionality. It turns out that people were more satisfied with the functionality of attractive, nonfunctional objects and unattractive, functional objects.

Controlling these robots wirelessly in an aquatic environment is challenging because of signal attenuation. This challenge is made even more difficult when this environment is the complex internal structure of a nuclear reactor. The cooling pipes of nuclear reactors are prone to corrosion along their weld lines. Traditional inspection methods are difficult, dangerous, and labor intensive. This thesis describes the development of a robotic architecture that implements two different kinds of wireless communication, radio and optical, that will allow for exploration and documentation of these pipes. This proposed architecture capitalizes on the best aspects of each communication method. In this system, two robots would be built that would work in tandem to document the pipe welds. One robot would communicate optically with the surface and via radio with the second robot who would explore the reactor. Additionally this thesis focused on developing the supporting software and electronics necessary to implement the proposed communication model. The electronics were refined to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) which could be used in a wide variety of robotic functions. The culmination of this thesis placed the developed electronics and program into an alpha prototype robot. This robot was used to analyze the movement of the a robot through water using a new type of propulsion mechanism. This first implementation of the designed software and electronics illustrates the adaptability of this work and its potential application in many iterations.",

They allow organizations to analyze risks and provide supply chain managers with a forward-looking approach to align their strategy with performance outcomes.

        "Abstrak": "This paper collects several notes I've written over the last year in an attempt to work through my dissatisfactions with the ideas about representation I was taught in school. Among these ideas are the notion of a 'world model'; the notion of representations having 'content' independent of the identity, location, attitudes, or activities of any agent; and the notion that a representation is the sort of thing you might implement with datastructures and pointers. Here I begin developing an alternative view of representation whose prototype is a set of instructions written in English on a sheet of paper you're holding in your hand while pursuing some ordinarily complicated concrete project in the everyday world. Figuring out what the markings on this paper are talking about is a fresh problem in every next setting, and solving this problem takes work. Several detailed stories about representation use in everyday activities—such as assembling a sofa from a kit, being taught to fold origami cranes, following stories across pages of a newspaper, filling a photocopier with toner, and keeping count when running laps—illustrate this view. Finally, I address the seeming tension between necessity of interpreting one's representations in every next setting and the idea that everyday life is fundamentally routine.",

        "Abstrak": "Ion transport membranes (ITMs) are dense ceramic membranes which have the potential for 100% selective separation of oxygen from air. ITMs operate at extreme temperatures (>800°C), necessary for the mobility of lattice oxygen ions: this can result in significant experimental challenges. Specifically, the local gas compositions at both the high oxygen (air) and low oxygen (sweep) surfaces influence the oxygen flux: these experimental measurements have not been available until now. A novel ITM research reactor has thus been developed which can directly sample gases at the membrane surface at high temperature flux conditions. This ITM reactor has been scaled up to allow for gas-probing instruments to be used without overly disrupting the experimental flowfield. The ITM stoichiometry investigated in this study is La₀.₉9Ca₀.₁1FeO3-[delta] (LCF), and has been chosen for its chemical stability attributes and consequent applicability to industry. Two modes of operation have been investigated using the LCF ITM in the reactor: inert (using CO₂ sweep gas to carry away an oxygen-enriched stream) and reactive (using CO₂:CH₄ sweep gas resulting in fuel reactions with the permeating oxygen). There is a huge advantage to running ITMs reactive: the oxygen flux can be enhanced by an order of magnitude or more, whilst useful fuel synthesis reactions can be actively enhanced by the catalytic ITM surface. This study therefore utilizes the local measurement capabilities of the novel ITM reactor to develop a physical understanding through oxygen flux models for both modes of operation: inert and reactive. Both flux models enable the prediction of the oxygen lux with the operating conditions necessary as input parameters. They are therefore useful tools for future optimization of ITM reactor designs. Further insight using the flux models is also provided. The inert flux model is used to determine the surface oxygen vacancy concentration which drives the oxygen flux. The reactive flux model is used in preliminary numerical simulations of ITM reactors to produce flux performance maps based on the input operating conditions.",

Chemically synthesized ZnS overcoated CdSe, (CdSe)ZnS, QDs are incorporated into a polymer host material. The main challenge in the preparation of QD-polymer composites is the prevention of both phase separation and aggregation of the QDs within the polymer host material, while sustaining the original quantum efficiency of the QDs in their growth solution. Possible ways to incorporate QDs into an optically clear polymer matrix are considered. A guideline for a successful QD-polymer composite is discussed for various polymer systems: ligand polymers, ligand monomer and covalent bonding to a polymer matrix, and in-situ polymerization. The best composite system is based on incorporation of QDs into a poly(laurylmethacrylate) matrix during in-situ polymerization in the presence of TOP ligands. The successful incorporation of QDs into a polymer host material demonstrates the ability to form QD-polymer composite light emitting materials. The emission spans nearly the entire region of saturated and mixed colors with narrow emission profiles. The light emission spectra of QD-polymer composites excited by a blue diode light are also simulated by Monte Carlo methods and compared to the measured spectra from actual devices. The synthesis and characterization of QD-microspheres, which can be used as active fluorescent building blocks, are also described.(cont.) In order to enhance the stability and compatibility of QDs in a polymer microsphere, the QDs are treated with polymerizable phosphine ligands, small oligomeric phosphine methacrylate (SOPM), and the following homogeneous solution polymerization is investigated to form monodisperse QD-microspheres. The QD-microspheres can store optical information assigned by embedded QDs in multiple codes. The surface functionalization of these capsules could provide a means for attaching capsules to surfaces and allow capsules to assemble into 3D structures.",

        "Abstrak": "The term jointness refers to activities or operations that are executed collaboratively by more than one government agency or military department. While joint operations have become increasingly common and successful, the government continues to struggle with joint system acquisition: in fact, although a common motivation for joint acquisition is cost savings, recent studies suggest that joint programs experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs and that it may be more cost effective for agencies to acquire systems independently rather than jointly. This thesis explains why joint programs often experience large cost growth and how jointness itself may induce it. To understand the cost of jointness, this thesis proposes and demonstrates a new approach for studying large, complex acquisition programs whereby the evolution of a program's organizational and technical architectures is quantified and observed using a design structure matrix (DSM)-based tool. Using this approach, one is able to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive a program's costs, as well as global perspective on cost growth throughout a program's lifecycle. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to study the cost impacts of jointness on three programs that developed environmental monitoring systems for low Earth orbit. The acquisition community's current understanding of joint programs suggests that jointness induces cost growth by increasing a program's organizational and technical complexity. However, using the DSM-based tool, this thesis demonstrates that complexity is a dynamic property of an acquisition program that is driven by government agencies' institutional interests and the actions that they motivate. Specifically, the thesis presents a more nuanced understanding of jointness, complexity, and cost growth by arguing that government agencies' institutional interest in retaining or regaining autonomy motivates actions that alter the agencies' relationships with one another, with the joint organization, and with the system under development. When agencies take action to retain or to regain autonomy, they increase the complexity of the joint organization or the joint system and the program's costs grow as result. Finally, the thesis discusses the implications of the proposed Agency Action Model both generally and specifically in the context of environmental monitoring programs. Aided by a trade space analysis tool that was developed to explore a broad set of concepts for future environmental monitoring systems, the thesis demonstrates how government leaders should approach the problem of joint program formulation and in doing so, generates a set a policy recommendations for future partnerships between the agencies that have historically collected environmental data from low Earth orbit.",

        "Abstrak": "There has been great recent interest in lithium storage at the anode of Li-ion rechargeable battery by alloying with metals such as Al, Sn, and Sb, or metalloids such as Si, as an alternative to the intercalation of graphite. This is due to the intrinsically high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of this type of anodes (can be over an order of magnitude of that of graphite). However, the Achilles' heel of these Li-Me alloys has been the poor cyclability, attributed to mechanical failure resulting from the large volume changes accompanying alloying. Me-oxides, explored as candidates for anode materials because of their higher cyclability relative to pure Me, suffer from the problem of first cycle irreversibility. In both these types of systems, much experimental and empirical data have been provided in the literature on a largely comparative basis (i.e. investigations comparing the anode behavior of some new material with older candidates). It is the belief of the author that, in order to successfully proceed with the development of better anode materials, and the subsequent design and production of batteries with better intrinsic energy densities, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the science and engineering of anode materials must be achieved, via a systematic and quantitative investigation of a variety of materials under a number of experimental conditions. In this thesis, the effects of composition and processing on microstructure and subsequent electrochemical behavior of anodes for Li-ion rechargeable batteries were investigated, using a number of approaches.(cont.) First, partial reduction of mixed oxides including Sb-V-O, Sb-Mn-O, Ag-V-O, Ag-Mn-O and Sn-Ti-O, was explored as a method to produce anode materials with high cyclability relative to pure metal anodes, and decreased first cycle irreversibility relative to previously produced metal-oxides. The highest cyclability was achieved with anode materials where the more noble metal of the mixed oxide was reduced internally, producing nanoscale active particles which were passivated by an inactive matrix. Second, a systematic study of various metal anode materials, including Si, Sn, Al, Sb and Ag, of different starting particle sizes was undertaken, in order to better understand the micromechanical mechanisms leading to poor cyclability in these pure metals. SEM of these materials revealed fracture in particles of > 1 pm after a single discharge/charge cycle, consistent with literature models which predict such fracture due to volumetric strains upon lithiation. However, TEM of these materials revealed a nanocrystalline structure after one cycle that in some metals was mixed with an amorphous phase. STEM of anode materials after 50 cycles revealed a dissociation of this nanostructure into nanoparticles, suggesting a failure mechanism other than volumetric strains, such as chemical attack. Finally, the appearance of the amorphous phase was investigated in lithiated Si, Sn, Ag and Al metal anode systems. A new mechanism, electrochemically-induced solid-state amorphization was proposed and explored via experiments using calibrated XRD and TEM. Experimental observations of these various Me systems subjected to different degrees of lithiation supported such phenomenon...",

        "Abstrak": "The U.S. Congress is considering a set of bills designed to limit the nation’s greenhouse gas (GHG)\r\nemissions. Several of these proposals call for a cap-and-trade system; others propose an emissions tax.\r\nThis paper complements the analysis by Paltsev et al. (2007) of cap-and-trade bills and applies the MIT\r\nEmissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to carry out an analysis of the tax proposals.\r\nSeveral lessons emerge from this analysis. First, a low starting tax rate combined with a low rate of\r\ngrowth in the tax rate will not reduce emissions significantly. Second, the costs of GHG reductions are\r\nreduced with the inclusion of non-CO2 gases in the carbon tax scheme. The costs of the Larson plan, for\r\nexample, fall by 20% with inclusion of the other GHGs. Third, welfare costs of the policies can be\r\naffected by the rate of growth of the tax, even after controlling for cumulative emissions. Fourth, a\r\ncarbon tax – like any form of carbon pricing – is regressive. However, general equilibrium\r\nconsiderations suggest that the short-run measured regressivity may be overstated. A portion of the\r\ncarbon tax is passed back to workers, owners of equity, and resource owners. To the extent that\r\nrelatively wealthy resource and equity owners bear some fraction of the tax burden, the regressivity will\r\nbe reduced. Additionally, the regressivity can be offset with a carefully designed rebate of some or all of\r\nthe revenue. Finally, the carbon tax bills that have been proposed or submitted are for the most part\r\ncomparable to many of the carbon cap-and-trade proposals that have been suggested. Thus the choice\r\nbetween a carbon tax and cap-and-trade system can be made on the basis of considerations other than\r\ntheir effectiveness at reducing emissions over some control period. Either approach (or some hybrid of\r\nthe two approaches) can be equally effective at reducing GHG emissions in the United States.",

Using a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy we explore the\r\neconomic viability of hydrogen transportation in several different tax and carbon dioxide stabilization\r\npolicy scenarios. We represent the capital, labor, fuel and other costs of hydrogen production and\r\nhydrogen powered vehicles in the economic model. We examine scenarios where the hydrogen fuel price\r\nand vehicle cost are varied over a wide range to evaluate what technology improvements would be\r\nneeded, in terms of cost reductions, for hydrogen vehicles to penetrate the market. We consider scenarios\r\nwith and without climate policy, and in competition with other reduced-carbon fuel substitutes, such as\r\nethanol-blend fuels. We find that hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles could make a significant\r\ncontribution to de-carbonization of the transportation fuel cycle if production of hydrogen itself is not\r\ncarbon-intensive. Cost targets needed for the technology to penetrate in the USA are such that the\r\nhydrogen fuel would need to be in the range of 1 to 1.7 times the 1997 price of gasoline and the vehicle\r\nmark-up above an average fuel cell automobile would need no more than 1.3 to 1.5 times an average\r\nconventional vehicle. At the lower end of these cost ranges, the vehicle fleet could be competitive by 2020\r\nbut at the upper end we would only see entry of the fleet toward the end of the century. High fuel taxes in\r\nEurope makes fuel-efficient hydrogen fuel cell technology more competitive there than in the USA. Along\r\nwith cost reductions, these results assume that technical issues are solved and that market hurdles of\r\nestablishing the fuel distribution system are overcome.

In this case a retrievable 19.7cm (7-3/4\") packer element for a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) environment was designed and tested. The element created a seal between the mandrel, or tubing, and the casing. At high temperature and pressure rubber needs to be contained so that it will create and maintain an energized seal. In this study only Aflas rubber was tested. Various backup systems were examined; some more traditional designs such as the carbon steel foldback ring were compared to more experimental ideas. Results of theoretical simulations were compared to actual test results in order to gain a greater understanding of element behavior. Experiments were also performed to study the process of element setting, which is difficult to observe due to the high pressures and temperatures required. In a related study alternative materials to rubber such as annealed high-conductivity oxygen-free copper were tested to determine if the properties could be applied for packer element applications. The most successful design was the foldback ring with an anti-extrusion PEEK ring under the gage ring. This design passed a liquid test at 134 MPa (19.5k psi) differential pressure and a gas test at 87.6 MPa (12.7k psi) differential pressure. New designs such as the split ring with mesh and the garter spring with mesh did not pass fixture tests but could be successful with further modifications. FEA was used as an analytical tool to create simulations of the element after a setting force is applied. The modeling was shown to correlate to the actual test results and therefore it would be a good tool to use in future studies.",

We use a KLEM dataset for 35 industries over 39 years to decompose changes in the aggregate energy-GDP ratio into shifts in sectoral composition (structural change) and adjustments in the energy demand of individual industries (intensity change). We find that although structural change offsets a rise in sectoral energy intensities from 1960 until the mid-1970s, after 1980 the change in the industrial mix has little impact and the average sectoral energy intensity experiences decline. Then, we use these data to econometrically estimate the influence on within-industry changes in energy intensity of price-induced substitution of variable inputs, shifts in the composition of capital and embodied and disembodied technical progress. Our results suggest that innovations embodied in information technology and electrical equipment capital stocks played a key role in energy intensityâ€™s long-run decline.",

        "Abstrak": "Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a family of extracellular matrix molecules with various functions in regulating tissue morphogenesis, cell division, and axon guidance. A number of CSPGs are highly upregulated by reactive glial scar tissues after injuries and form a strong barrier for axonal regeneration in the adult vertebrate CNS. Although CSPGs may negatively regulate axonal growth via binding and altering activity of other growth-regulating factors, the molecular mechanisms by which CSPGs restrict axonal elongation are not well understood. Here, we identified a novel receptor mechanism whereby CSPGs inhibit axonal growth via interactions with neuronal transmembrane leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (LAR). CSPGs bind LAR with high affinity in transfected COS-7 cells and coimmunoprecipitate with LAR expressed in various tissues including the brain and spinal cord. CSPG stimulation enhances activity of LAR phosphatase in vitro. Deletion of LAR in knock-out mice or blockade of LAR with sequence-selective peptides significantly overcomes neurite growth restrictions of CSPGs in neuronal cultures. Intracellularly, CSPG–LAR interaction mediates axonal growth inhibition of neurons partially via inactivating Akt and activating RhoA signals. Systemic treatments with LAR-targeting peptides in mice with thoracic spinal cord transection injuries induce significant axon growth of descending serotonergic fibers in the vicinity of the lesion and beyond in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery. Identification of LAR as a novel CSPG functional receptor provides a therapeutic basis for enhancing axonal regeneration and functional recovery after CNS injuries in adult mammals.",

        "Abstrak": "In the first chapter, I study the impact of statistical arbitrage on equilibrium asset prices. Arbitrageurs have to learn about the long-run behavior of the stock price process. They condition their investment strategy on the observation of price and volume. The learning process of the statistical arbitrageurs leads to an optimal trading strategy that can be upward sloping in prices. The presence of privately informed investors makes the equilibrium price dependent on the history of trading volume. The response of prices to news is nonlinear, and little news can have large effects in some ranges of the prices. In the second chapter, together with Francesco Franzoni, we develop an equilibrium model of learning about time-varying risk factor loadings. In the model, CAPM holds from investors' ex-ante perspective. However, positive mispricing can be observed when investors' expectations of beta are above ex-post realizations. This model is used to explain the 'value premium'. In a learning framework, the fact that value stocks used to be more risky in the past leads to investors' expectations of beta that exceed the estimates from more recent samples. We propose an empirical methodology that takes investors' expectations of the factor loadings explicitly into account when estimating betas. With the adjusted estimates of beta, we can explain the cross-section of average returns of the ten book-to-market portfolios, and account for the value premium in the relevant sample. The third chapter investigates the role of contagion during the Great Depression. The Great Depression was a worldwide phenomenon, accompanied by financial crisis. I investigate whether financial contagion contributed to the spread of the Great Depression across countries. Contagion happens when idiosyncratic shocks are transmitted from one country to another.(cont.) Asset price movements in the country affected by contagion are not justified by its own fundamentals. Contagion leads to an increase in the covariance of international financial markets during periods of financial crisis. Two particular events are tested: the stock market crash of 1929 and the Latin American debt crises of 1931. In both events the hypothesis that the crises spread contagiously is rejected with one exception: the French Stock Market.",

        "Abstrak": "The first essay finds that the market betas of value and small stocks have decreased by about 75% in the second half of the twentieth century. The decline in beta can be related to a long-term improvement in economic conditions that made these companies less risky. The failure to account for time-series variation of beta in unconditional CAPM regressions can explain as much as 30% of the value premium. In some samples, about 80% of the value premium can be explained by assuming that investors tied their expectations of the riskiness of these stocks to the high values of beta prevailing in the early years. Moving from these findings, the second essay (co-authored with Tobias Adrian) explores in detail the relation between the 'value premium' and the decrease in value stocks' beta. We develop an equilibrium model of learning on time-varying risk factor loadings. In the model the CAPM holds from investors' ex-ante perspective. However, the econometrician can observe positive mispricing, whenever the expected beta is above the true level. Given the finding of a decreasing beta, it is likely that investors' expectation of the beta of these stocks has been above the actual level. Therefore, our model can provide an explanation for the 'value premium'. We present the results of simulations in which the model accounts for up to 80% of the 'value premium' in the 1963-2000 sample.(cont.) The third essay analyzes the response of stock returns to earnings information. First, I test the assumption that market expectations of earnings reflect a seasonal random walk, despite the actual process being autoregressive. This hypothesis is rejected. Second, I test the opposite view that expectations are unbiased. The data rejects this possibility for small firms. On the other hand, large firms' prices provide evidence of efficiency. Finally, I show that in the case of small firms the market understates the autoregression coefficient in the earnings process, and it incorrectly assumes that this coefficient is positive, even when actual earnings are seasonal random walks.",

The second essay evaluates a government program that targeted credit to small firms through existing financial intermediaries. Using the program eligibility rule to identify the effect on target firms, I find that target firms' total bank debt increased by 8 cents for every dollar of program financing provided to the banks. This effect is larger when the intermediary bank is more likely to lend to smaller firms according to observable bank characteristics. The third essay evaluates empirically the effect of credit history disclosure on the financial position of a sample of manufacturing firms in Argentina.

        "Abstrak": "This thesis brings together three essays on issues in the economics of health insurance. The first study considers the effects of average per-patient caps on Medicare reimbursement for home health care, which took effect in October 1997. I use regional variation in the restrictiveness of per-patient caps to identify the short-run effects of this reimbursement change on home health agency behavior, beneficiary health care utilization, and health status. The empirical evidence suggests that agencies responded to the caps by shifting the composition of their caseload towards healthier beneficiaries. In addition, I find that decreases in home care utilization were associated with an increase in outpatient care, and had little adverse impact on the health status of beneficiaries. In the second paper, I examine the impact of Medicare balance billing restrictions on physician behavior and on beneficiary spending. My findings include a significant decline in out-of-pocket expenditures for medical care by elderly households, but no impact on the quantity of care received or in the duration of office visits. The third paper (written with Jonathan Gruber) explores the causes of the dramatic rise in employee contributions to employer-provided health insurance over the past 20 years. We find that there was a large impact of falling tax rates, rising eligibility for insurance through the Medicaid system and through spouses, and deteriorating economic conditions (in the late 1980s and early 1990s). We also find more modest impacts of increased managed care penetration and rising health care costs. Overall, this set of factors can explain about one-quarter of the rise in employee contributions over the 1982-1996 period.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation consists of three essays on the effects of intellectual property rights protection on market structure and social welfare in the Indian pharamaceutical industry. In contrast to pharmaceutical industries in the developed world, India had historically enforced a weak system of intellectual property rights protection that eliminated most legal barriers to entry in its pharmaceuticals markets. As a condition of its membership to the World Trade Organization, India became required to extend legal protection to all pharmaceutical products by 2005. The first essay analyzes the dramatic increase in the number of products released by domestic firms in India in the period leading up to the 2005 deadline. Speculation in the media linked this phenomenon to the imminent change in patent regime. The essay uses data on pharmaceutical products being sold in India in combination with data on drugs patented internationally to investigate the possibility that Indian firms launched products in the domestic industry as a strategic response to the anticipated change implied by the WTO. Results of the estimation do not provide conclusive evidence of strategic behavior by firms in markets where the patent enforcement could affect the future profitability of domestic firms.(cont.) The results suggest that much of the increase in product launches was driven by the size of the market and the age of the drugs in question. However, without more information on counterfactual current and future profits, we cannot rule out strategic behaviour by domestic firms. The second essay develops a structural model of demand, supply and entry and relates the free entry setting of the industry during the sample period to two sets of welfare issues. The model incorporates firm heterogeneity and product differentiation and backs out demand and supply-side parameters for five key therapeutic categories in the industry. Results of the estimation show that demand varies significantly across the therapeutic categories and that firm heterogeneity is an important factor for both demand and entry costs. Counterfactual simulations of the effect of entry by foreign firms into selected drugs find no evidence of socially \"excessive\" entry; on the contrary, the simulations suggest large gains to consumers from the addition of more firms, which would overwhelm the losses to producers and thus increase social welfare.(cont.) Simulations of the welfare effects of patent enforcement in India for four drugs that were under patent protection in the US at the time show losses of over $1 million on average for consumers in these markets and an average reduction in market size of approximately 35,000 patients. In comparison, the increase in profits of the global patent-holders for these drug are estimated to range between $0.08 million and $0.5 million. These gains are modest, particularly in comparison to the costs of global drug development that range between $200 million and $300 million. The third essay looks for empirical evidence of early-mover advantages for pioneering firms in pharmaceutical products markets in India. The first half of the paper employs fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Estimates from this basic model suggest that an earlier entry translates into positive gains for firms, in terms of both higher prices and higher revenues. The second half of the paper tackles the sample selection issues arising from the fact that firms choose their own orders of entry. A firm's order of entry into a market is modelled as a continuous decision variable at the first-stage. The selection model then uses the residuals from this first-stage to correct the sample selection bias at the second-stage.(cont.) The order of entry continues to have a strong effect on the price and revenue received by a firm, with earlier entrants retaining larger long-term advantages. In particular, after accounting for the endogeneity of entry, results suggest that the pure order-of-entry effect on revenue allows the first entrant into a market to earn more than two times the revenue of the fifth entrant and over six times the revenue of the tenth entrant.",

        "Abstrak": "In this dissertation, I present three empirical essays that encompass topics in industrial organization. The first essay examines the degree of competition and spatial differentiation in the retail industry by exploiting a unique dataset that describes a consumer's choice of store, product of purchase, item price, and demographics. I estimate a consumer's choice of retailer in the sales market for DVDs among online, mass merchant, electronics, video specialty, and music stores, and I allow for unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for store types and disutility of travel. A consumer's traveling cost varies by income, and substitution occurs proportionately more among stores of the same type. The second essay investigates an intriguing puzzle in the movie industry: \"why do studios cluster their big theatrical hits during the July 4th weekend?\" A series of recent papers by Einav (2002) indicate that although the underlying demand for theatrical movies remains high around Labor Day, studios tend to release their high quality movies at the beginning of the summer. I employ data from the home video industry to provide more evidence on whether booms in theatrical revenues are supply- or demand-driven and to investigate why firms might cluster their releases as they do.(cont.) The third essay presents examples based on actual and synthetic datasets to illustrate how simulation methods can often mask identification problems in the estimation of mixed logit models. Typically, simulation methods approximate an integral (that does not have a closed form) by taking draws from the underlying distribution of the random variable of integration. The examples reveal how a \"low\" number of draws can generate estimates that appear identified, but in fact, are either not theoretically identified by the model or not empirically identified by the data. The number of draws required to reveal the identification problem will depend on the data, model, and type of draws used. These examples emphasize the importance of checking the stability of the estimates with respect to the number of draws.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation analyzes the impact of various financial incentives on firm behavior. The first two chapters examine product-market and input-market effects of a firm's capital structure and the incentives they create. The third chapter analyzes how incentives from the tort system affect physician location decisions. Chapter 1 examines the impact of union bargaining on capital structure determination. If a firm maintains a high level of liquidity, workers may be encouraged to raise wage demands. In the presence of external finance constraints, a firm has an incentive to use the cash flow demands of debt service payments to improve its bargaining position. Using both cross-sectional estimates of firm-level collective bargaining coverage and state changes in labor law to identify changes in union bargaining power, I show that firms indeed appear to use financial leverage strategically to influence collective bargaining negotiations. These estimates suggest that strategic incentives from union bargaining have a substantial impact on financing decisions. A firm's financial structure can also impact investments in marketing and operations management. Chapter 2 examines how capital structure affects a firm's provision of product availability - an important dimension of product quality in the retail sector.(cont.) Using U.S. consumer price index microdata to measure the prevalence of out-of-stocks, I find that supermarket leveraged buyouts, which reduce liquidity, increase out-of-stocks by 10 percent. These findings suggest it is important for firms to consider these sorts of real effects on their operations when setting financial policy. Chapter 3 examines financial incentives created by medical malpractice liability. If patients bear the full incidence of cost changes and market demand is inelastic, then marginal changes in malpractice liability will not affect physicians' net income or location decisions. Using county-level, specialty-specific data on physician location from 1970 to 2000, I find that damage caps do not affect physician supply for the average resident of states adopting reforms. On the other hand, caps appear to increase the supply of specialist physicians in the most rural areas by 10 to 12 percent. This is likely because rural doctors face greater uninsured litigation costs and a more elastic demand for medical services.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis consists of three essays on information, decision-making and health. All three concern the relationship between the choices consumers would make if they were \"fully informed\" in an appropriate sense and the choices we actually observe. Chapter 1 considers how we can determine whether consumers are appropriately taking into account health information when they make their food consumption decisions. The fundamental idea is to determine the value of a statistical life (VSL) implicit in food consumption decisions and to compare this value with previous estimates of the VSL. The main positive result is that the VSL estimated from food consumption is about 1/10th as large as estimates from other contexts. I also consider the normative implications under the assumption that VSL estimates from other contexts indicate how individuals would behave if they were \"fully informed\" and discuss what additional evidence might support such an assumption. Chapter 2, co-authored with Jonathan Gruber, performs an analogous exercise in the case of health care plans. Where Chapter 1 makes the normative assumption that consumers should value years of life equally regardless of where they come from (e.g. eating healthier foods or reducing risk of on-the-job death), Chapter 2 makes the normative assumption that consumers should value a dollar of cost savings equivalently whether it comes through premiums or out of pocket costs. This restriction can then be used to evaluate whether consumers are choosing appropriately. The chapter studies this question in the context of Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, the most significant privatization of the delivery of a public insurance benefit in recent history. Chapter 3 attempts to consider the circumstances in which the partial equilibrium welfare analyses performed in parts 1 and 2 extend to a general equilibrium setting in which prices and product characteristics respond endogenously to changes in demand. In particular, Chapter 3 derives conditions under which more information leads to welfare gains in general equilibrium taking into account the endogenous response of firms' pricing and product quality decisions.",

        "Abstrak": "The chapters in this thesis tackle different questions, but share the attempt to open the \"black box\" of the relationship between institutions and economic outcomes. In the first chapter, I examine mass media's role in countering special interest group influence by studying county-level support for US Senate candidates from 1980 to 2002. I use the concentration of campaign contributions from Political Action Committees to proxy capture of politicians by special interests, and compare the reaction to increases in concentration by voters covered by two types of media markets - in-state and out-of-state media markets. Unlike in-state media markets, out-of-state markets focus on neighboring states' politics and elections. Consistent with the idea that citizens punish political capture exposed in the media, I find that an increase in concentration of special interest contributions reduces candidate's vote shares in in-state counties relative to the out-of-state counties, where the candidate receives less coverage. The second chapter (with Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson) examines the effect of population growth on violent conflict. Exploiting the international epidemiological transition starting in the 1940s, we construct an instrument for changes in population (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007) and find that countries with higher (exogenous) increases in population experimented larger increases in social conflict. Using a simple theoretical framework, we interpret these findings as evidence that a larger population generates greater competition for resources and makes violence more likely if institutions cannot handle the higher level of disputes. The third dissertation chapter asks the following question: if property rights in land are so beneficial, why are they not adopted more widely? I propose a theory based on the idea that limited property rights over peasants' plots may be supported by elite landowners to achieve two goals. First, limited property rights reduce peasants' income from their own plots, generating a cheap labour force. Second, they force peasants to remain in the rural sector to protect their property, even if job opportunities appear in the urban sector. The theory identifies conditions under which weak property rights institutions emerge, and provides a specific mechanism for the endogenous persistence of inefficient rural institutions.",

        "Abstrak": "Chapter 1 contains a theory of misallocation. In contrast to a recent literature where misallocation stems from imperfect input markets, I study an economy with non-competitive output markets. This change of focus has two implications. In the cross-section of firms, static misallocation, i.e. the dispersion of marginal products, is not driven by constraints limiting expansion possibilities, but reflects the distribution of mark-ups. Dynamically, the distribution of mark-ups and the economy-wide rate of productivity growth are jointly determined by firms' innovation and entry incentives. The observed cross-country variation in the degree of misallocation might therefore be a symptom of more fundamental differences in the innovation environment. Using firm-level data from Indonesia, I present both reduced form evidence for this mechanism and estimate the models' structural parameters. In chapter 2, I study the interaction between migration and firms' technology choices. If firms can adapt their production technology, changes in labor supply will induce biased technological adoption. I test this hypothesis using data from one of the largest population transfer programs of the 20th century. After WW2, Germany lost part of its Eastern Territories. Within 2 years, more than 8m people were expelled and transferred to Western Germany. Using individual-level data of the 1960s and 70s I show that refugees experienced substantial reallocation into unskilled occupations, that refugee-rich counties have higher employment shares in occupations which require little formal human capital and that wages in those occupations are especially high in refugee-rich counties. In chapter 3, which is joint work with Joaquin Blaum and Claire Lelarge, we use a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing firms to study firms' import behavior. We first document a new fact on the extensive margin of international trade: most firms source only few differentiated varieties of a given product internationally. We then build a simple model based on productivity differences across firms and show that in contrast to the literature on exports, more productive firms do not necessarily source their products from more countries. On the intensive margin, the theory has one robust implication: expenditure shares across varieties should be equalized in the cross-section of firms. While the data is supportive of this prediction across foreign varieties, more productive firms are subject to \"home-bias\" in that they spend too much on domestic inputs.",

A spirometer is high precision pressure transducer which measures the speed of sound in a gas through the emission and reception of ultrasonic pulses, commonly used in medicine to measure patient lung capacity. The spirometer was successfully calibrated to measure gas composition to an accuracy of 1.75% ± 1.23% by ratio by weight. By using a spirometer, the speed of sound was measured for a trapped volume of Argon CO₂ mixtures at ratios of 80 : 20, 85 : 15, 90 : 10, 95 : 5, and 100 : 0. The temperature dependence of the transit time was observed to behave according to the Laplace Formula, except for the presence of dramatic drops that were dependent on the Argon concentration. An argument is presented that these drops are technical limitations of the spirometer.",

In order to fully define breakup kinematics for the stationary deuterium target, the following are measured: incident neutron beam energy, scattered proton energy and angle, and one of the scattered neutron angles. The proton energy is determined using a permanent magnet spectrometer, consisting of two permanent magnets placed between two wire chamber detectors. A particle tracking code uses the particle hit positions in the wire chambers to determine the proton's curvature (and hence deduce its energy) as it passes through the magnetic field of the magnets. Monte Carlo simulations show that the kinetic energy resolution is better at lower proton energies, when the magnetic field bends the particle more. The ultimate goal of the experiment is to measure the five-fold differential cross section to look for effects of three-nucleon forces.",

Among those, generating a quantum code on a locally planar geometry have lead to some interesting classes of codes. Main idea of this thesis stems from Kitaev's Toric code, which was the first surface code, yet it suffered from having a asymptotically vanishing encoding rate. In this paper, we propose a quantum surface code on a more complicated closed surface which has large genus, namely the Hurwitz surface. This code admits a constant encoding rate in the asymptotic limit that the number of genus goes to infinity. However, we give evidence that t/n, where n is the number of qubits and t is the number of correctible errors, converges to 0 asymptotically. This is based on numerically generating many Hurwitz surfaces and observing the corresponding quantum code in the limit that genus number goes to infinity.",

Patterns formed in arrays of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) have been extensively studied for these applications. However, the as-deposited features are often undesirably altered upon liquid infiltration and evaporation because of capillarity-driven aggregation of low density CNT forests. Here, it is shown that an ultrathin, conformal, and low-surface-energy layer of poly perfluorodecyl acrylate, poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (pPFDA), makes the VA-CNTs robust against surface-tension-driven aggregation and densification. This single vapor-deposition step allows the fidelity of the as-deposited VA-CNT patterns to be retained during wet processing, such as inking, and subsequent drying. It is demonstrated how to establish omniphobicity or liquid infiltration by controlling the surface morphology. Retaining a crust of entangled CNTs and pPFDA aggregates on top of the patterned VA-CNTs produces micropillars with re-entrant features that prevent the infiltration of low-surface-tension liquids and thus gives rise to stable omniphobicity. Plasma treatments before and after polymer deposition remove the crust of entangled CNTs and pPFDA aggregates and attach hydroxyl groups to the CNT tips, enabling liquid infiltration yet preventing densification of the highly porous CNTs. The latter observation demonstrates the protective character of the pPFDA coating with the potential application of these surfaces for direct contact printing of microelectronic features.",

This paper first provides a comprehensive account of the history of various forms of air rights in New York City, particularly chronicling how such air rights have developed and changed over time to the present day. Following on this understanding, and using these two recently-constructed residential towers as examples, this paper provides detailed narratives describing how these projects assembled their development rights, and how this spatial envelope was used. The paper concludes with a canonical comparison of the acquisition prices of these development rights with their final sales prices and a regression of the price on floor height and size.",

It was established in the 1950's that the effectiveness of a thermoelectric could approximately be described in terms of a dimensionless figure of merit ... being respectively the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity of the material. Until recently, ZT1 was the best performance these materials could achieve. However, the field of thermoelectrics advanced rapidly in the five last years, leading to the first significant breakthroughs in this area in the past fifty years, with materials with ZT up to 3 being reported. It is therefore interesting to wonder what new applications and markets these improvements at the material level could lead to. The first section of this thesis is a review of the principles of TE technology, the current materials and their level of performance. The recent materials developments are also described.(cont.) The commercialization of TE is then discussed, along with the requirements in terms of performance and costs which would have to be achieved to make TE a further commercial success. Eventually, a business model for one of the applications is developed.

The modeling and sensitivity analysis of the system are covered within this thesis. Two models were built using first principles, and a range of physiological parameter values were used to estimate the forces and stresses generated by the perfusion flow. A third dynamical model from the literature was also employed. A computational approach using finite element modeling was also employed as a further tool for analysis.

This paper, then, investigates the effects of treatment timing using Zoledronate [ZOL], a potent bisphosphonate, on the lumbar and caudal vertebrae in ovariectomized [OVX], female Wistar rats. Methods: Twenty nine rats were divided into four groups according to their treatment: OVX at week 0 (n=5), OVX+earlyZOL (20 jig/kg s.c. week 0, n=8), OVX+late ZOL (20 jlg/kg s.c. week 8, n=7), and SHAM-OVX (n=9). Results: Micro-computed tomography (giCT) evaluation of six parameters characterizing bone morphology [BV/TV, ConnD, SMI, TbTh, TbNr, and TbSp] showed slightly favorable effects with early ZOL treatment in the fourth lumbar [L4] vertebrae. Compared to SHAM-OVX, OVX has a significantly (p<0.05) lower BV/TV, higher SMI, and TbSp. OVX+earlyZOL had a significantly higher BV/TV than OVX and SHAM-OVX and a lower TbSp than OVX.(cont.) Decreasing trends but no statistically significant differences were reached in the cortical thickness with treatment, nor were there any differences in bone morphology between the groups in the sixth caudal vertebrae [CD6]. A two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction between the vertebral site and treatment group for BV/TV and TbSp. jCT and static compression tests on the L3 and L4 of rats in a secondary study revealed significant correlations in architectural parameters and biomechanical properties between the two vertebrae. L4 had a higher BV/TV, SMI, and minimum area [minA] and a lower TbNr and TbSp than L3, but L4 had lower values for stiffness, energy to failure [energy], and ultimate load. Regression analysis also showed statistically significant correlations between ultimate load [Uload] and total bone volume [BV], energy and BV, Uload and minA, stiffness and minA, and energy and minA. Conclusion: Results showed slightly favorable trends on bone microstructure for early treatment and demonstrated the potential for clinical advantages using preventative therapy. Upon further research in understanding the vertebrae's response to ZOL at different time points after OVX, treatment for osteoporosis may be better directed.",

        "Abstrak": "The field of DNA nanotechnology has rapidly evolved over the past three decades, reaching a point where researchers can conceive of and implement both bioinspired and biomimetic devices using the programmed self-assembly of DNA molecules. The sophisticated natural systems that these devices seek to interrogate and to imitate have Angstrom-level organizational precision, however, and the nanotechnology community faces the challenge of fine-tuning their design principles to match. A necessity for achieving this level of spatial control is an understanding of the atomic-level physico-chemical interactions and temporal dynamics inherent to fundamental structural motifs used for nanodevice design. The stacked configurational isomers of four-way junctions, the motif on which DNA nanotechnology was founded, are the focus of this work; initially in isolation and then as part of larger DNA nano-assemblies. The first study presented here investigates the impact of sequence on the structure, stability, and flexibility of these junction isomers, along with their canonical B-form duplex, nicked-duplex and single cross-over topological variants. Using explicit solvent and counterion molecular dynamics simulations, the base-pair level interactions that influence experimentally-observed conformational state preferences are interrogated and free-energy calculations provide a detailed theoretical picture of isomerization thermodynamics. Next, the synergy of single molecule imaging, computational modelling, and a novel enzymatic assay is exploited to characterize the three-dimensional structure and catalytic function of a DNA tweezer-actuated nanoreactor. The analyses presented here show that rational redesign of the four-way junctions in the device enables the tweezers to be more completely and uniformly closed, while the sequence-level design strategies explored in this study provide guidelines for improving the performance of DNA-based structures. Finally, MD simulations are used to inform finite-element method coarse-grained models for the ground-state structure determination and equilibrium Brownian Dynamics of large-scale DNA origamis. Together, this thesis presents a set of guidelines for the rational design of nanodevices comprising arrays of constrained four-way junctions.",

Correlation amongst the data was examined to help discern what might drive such markets. While numerous factors were observed within this study, the most significant results were observed regarding consumer knowledge and technology's role. Consumers tended to pick the products which they felt were most useful. Such a choice often did not correspond to the technologically superior product.

Balance simulations were performed to control the center of mass location of a robot modeled as an inverted pendulum. The controlled center of mass trajectories with state estimates generated from Kalman filtering were compared, where possible, to the CM trajectory based on unfiltered sensor measurements of the states. For the simple case of inverted pendulum control, it was determined that noise and error in the IMU are sufficiently small that Kalman filtering is not necessary when all states can be measured, but results in significant improvements in the RMS error of the actual and desired center of mass positions.",

This study examines the behavior of such materials in two and three dimensions when void volume fraction is varied and a thin-film coating is incorporated. Computer modeling was used to predict and understand the mechanics of the transformation behavior; results showed that three-dimensional specimens behaved like their 2D counterparts and that addition of the film influenced structural transformation. Specifically, increasing volume fraction brought pattern transformation at lower values of stress and strain. Conversely, film presence postponed transformation and made it a gradual process. The film also showed considerable out-of-plane displacement and created a channel which spanned the structure. Out-of-plane motion and pattern transformation were verified experimentally by loading a 90 x 110 mm specimen to a strain of about 13% using a testing fixture. Although conducted in the macroscopic domain, experimental behavior can be expected at smaller length scales. The transformations and the surface topology alterations are reversible upon unloading, giving the ability to use deformation as a means of tuning or switching wave propagation properties that depend on periodicity, and surface properties that depend on topology.",

This paper extends previous research done by a group of MIT students into a low cost device for effective compaction of used oil filters. Testing is done on compacting heads of various shapes to determine crushing geometries to improve volume reduction for a given load.

Alpha-smooth muscle actin ([alpha]-SMA) is the protein responsible for contraction, thus determining if it is present in embryos which heal by regeneration will further our knowledge about the causes of regenerative healing. This thesis experimentally determined the presence of [alpha]-SMA in these cell types by the following procedure. Embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells of various species were cultured and seeded into collagen scaffolds. Contractile behavior was determined by measuring the diameter change of the scaffolds over time. Alpha-smooth muscle actin presence was determined by immunohistochemical evaluation. This study found that while all the cell types displayed alpha smooth muscle actin presence in monolayer, not every cell type contracted when seeded into the collagen scaffolds designed to mimic the in vivo environment. Specifically, the embryonic stem cells did not contract. Upon staining, the embryonic stem cell seeded scaffolds and several of the mesenchymal stem cell seeded scaffolds, which did contract, did not stain positive for [alpha]-SMA. These results imply that the embryonic scaffolds did not generate actin filament bundles, and that several of the mesenchymal stem cell seeded scaffolds were imaged after [alpha]-SMA expression in them ceased.",

The main benefit of cable robots is their large workspace size, which makes them well suited for broadcasting, transporting/loading, and construction applications. Since cables can only pull and not push the end-effector however, designing and controlling cable robots becomes more challenging. This thesis describes the design of a three-cable underconstrained robot which was built and then tested using a velocity feedback loop with a built-in PI controller. The endeffector of the robot consists of a camcorder mounted on a platform. The objective of the robot is to manipulate the camcorder in 3-D space with minimal tracking error. The dynamic equations of the system are derived along with the kinematic relationships and a closed-loop controller is designed. The controller is tested by prescribing a trajectory to the end-effector. Simulink derives the motor velocities given the desired Cartesian positions of the end-effector and simultaneously controls all three motors. The results of the experiment show that the error in the trajectory, which is on the order of about seven centimeters in the x -y plane, is small compared to the size of the robot's workspace. However, depending on the required precision, improvements may have to be made to the robot to reduce error. Future research ideas are presented to expand the scope of the robot.",

The complexity of 34 student robots was analyzed using metrics such as the percentage of moving components in the mechanism. Gender differences in scores on the spatial visualization test were significant, consistent with results of prior studies. A significant correlation between spatial reasoning and origami experience was found for male students tested. Most mechanism complexity criteria were not found to be significantly correlated with spatial-visual ability, although the correlation between the percentage of moving components and spatial test scores approached significance with a negative correlation.

Bubble mechanics are studied in the pursuit of a biomimetic solution for transporting air bubbles underwater. Careful experimentation is performed to understand the mechanics of bubble formation and capture. Investigation of bubble formation through an underwater nozzle shows that bubble volume increases by 15% when parallel rods are spaced above the nozzle at the same width as the inner diameter of the nozzle. Bubble volume decreases linearly with increasing air injection rate. Decreasing surface tension by approximately 40% decreases bubble volume by approximately 20%. Changing the angle the nozzle from parallel to perpendicular with the bottom of the tank increases bubble volume 40%. Based on trends observed in the nozzle experiments and using the spider's mechanisms for bubble capture as inspiration, a bubble capture device is manufactured. Decreasing the surface tension of the fluid by 25% decreases captured bubble volume by 50%. Below a device submersion speed of approximately 2.4 mm/s, bubble formation was at a maximum for the device, regardless of fluid surface tension. This research elucidates the limitations on bubble capture by the water spider. For future applications, these limitations can be pinpointed and adjusted for more efficient bubble capture and plastron maintenance.",

The intent is to build a matrix of several hundred turbines at MIT as part of the 150th anniversary celebration in 2011. The main focus is the appearance of the turbines, which are fabricated using a novel dual-layer vacuum-forming process. In it, one layer of pre-cut plastic is sandwiched between a polyurethane foam mold and a top layer of plastic which is heated and forms the seal for the vacuum. The top layer is subsequently removed and discarded leaving a formed part with clean, smooth edges. In order to optimize the manufacturing process and achieve repeatable results, variables such as heating time and material alignment had to be controlled. PETG and polystyrene were tested in a variety of configurations to maximize the respective strengths of each material and minimize their weaknesses. Each turbine is also designed to power its own LEDs. Potential designs for the necessary electronics are also included.",

This thesis covers experiments done throughout this period, which can be grouped in three sets of studies. First, degenerate 6Li Fermi gases have been produced by sympathetic cooling with bosonic 23Na. For this, an existing 23Na Bose-Einstein condensation apparatus was upgraded to an experiment capable of producing degenerate 6Li Fermi gases and 6Li-23Na degenerate Fermi-Bose mixtures. The cooling methods have been developed in two different stages, resulting in the production of degenerate 6Li Fermi gases with temperatures below 0.05 TF and up to 7 x 107 atoms, and of degenerate 6Li-23Na mixtures with a few million atoms in each of the components. Second, the properties of 6Li-23Na mixtures at different magnetic fields have been investigated, resulting in the discovery of three interspecies 6Li-23Na Feshbach resonances, which opens up the possibility to study strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures in this system. This investigations also led to the observation of other Feshbach resonances in 6Li and 23Na. Third, the properties of strongly interacting 6Li spin mixtures in the strong interacting regime near a Feshbach resonance have been investigated. Weakly bound 6Li2 molecules have been produced and Bose condensed on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance. Pure molecular condensates with up to 3 x 106 molecules have been produced.(cont.) The properties of the interacting Fermi gas were investigated on the attractive side of the resonance using rapid field ramps to the other side of the resonance. Fermion pairing, and condensation of these pairs was observed near the resonance, offering evidence for superfluid behavior in a strongly interacting Fermi gas.",

        "Abstrak": "Quantum mechanics has led not only to new physical theories, but also a new understanding of information and computation. Quantum information not only yields new methods for achieving classical tasks such as factoring and key distribution but also suggests a completely new set of quantum problems, such as sending quantum information over quantum channels or efficiently performing particular basis changes on a quantum computer. This thesis contributes two new, purely quantum, tools to quantum information theory-coherent classical communication in the first half and an efficient quantum circuit for the Schur transform in the second half. The first part of this thesis (Chapters 1-4) is in fact built around two loosely overlapping themes. One is quantum Shannon theory, a broad class of coding theorems that includes Shannon and Schumacher data compression, channel coding, entanglement distillation and many others. The second, more specic, theme is the concept of using unitary quantum interactions to communicate between two parties. We begin by presenting new formalism: a general framework for Shannon theory that describes communication tasks in terms of fundamental information processing resources, such as entanglement and classical communication. Then we discuss communication with unitary gates and introduce the concept of coherent classical communication, in which classical messages are sent via some nearly unitary process. We find that coherent classical communication can be used to derive several new quantum protocols and unify them both conceptually and operationally with old ones.(cont.) Finally, we use these new protocols to prove optimal trade-o curves for a wide variety of coding problems in which a noisy channel or state is consumed and two noiseless resources are either consumed or generated at some rate. The second half of the thesis (Chapters 5-8) is based on the Schur transform, which maps between the computational basis of (Cd)n and a basis (known as the Schur basis) which simultaneously diagonalizes the commuting actions of the symmetric group Sn and the unitary group Ud. The Schur transform is used as a subroutine in many quantum communication protocols (which we review and further develop), but previously no polynomial-time quantum circuit for the Schur transform was known. We give such a polynomial-time quantum circuit based on the Clebsch-Gordan transform and then give algorithmic connections between the Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform on Sn.",

        "Abstrak": "Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is studied in plasmas relevant to inertial confinement fusion (ICF). The Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell code ELVIS was developed and run for this purpose. Plasma waves are heavily Landau damped in the regimes of interest, and coupled-mode theory predicts back-scattered SRS is a convective instability. Simulations in a finite length, homogeneous plasma show electron trapping drastically elevates the reflected light over convective gain values (\"kinetic enhancement\"). Average reflectivities are [approx.] 10%, while the instantaneous reflectivity is chaotic and does not reach a steady state. Trapping reduces the plasma-wave Landau damping and downshifts the observed frequencies from their linear values. Two longitudinal acoustic (? ? k) features and light from possible stimulated electron acoustic scattering (SEAS) are present. The phase-matched SEAS plasmon lies on the observed acoustic mode with phase velocity 1.3(Te/me)1/2. As the pump laser intensity is increased or the electron temperature is decreased, SRS transitions sharply from the coupled-mode steady state to kinetically enhanced levels. Enhancement happens for different back SRS seed levels and monochromatic or broadband seeds. Simulations with a Krook relaxation operator to mimic speckle sideloss display enhancement when resonant electrons complete a bounce orbit before escaping, with a sharp onset as the relaxation rate varies. The sudden development of kinetic enhancement as parameters change suggests trapping makes SRS absolutely unstable.(cont.) Simulations with mobile ions give kinetic enhancement until a burst of activity occurs near the laser entrance, after which back SRS is low. The burst contains several Brillouin and Raman re-scatters and subsequent Langmuir decay instability (LDI), although no LDI of back SRS is seen. SRS runs in a density gradient show kinetic enhancement for long scale lengths and coupledmode convective levels for shorter ones. The reflectivity is higher when the pump propagates toward higher, rather than lower, density. The amplitude of externally-driven plasma waves in a density gradient is also enhanced over linear levels and displays a similar directional asymmetry. These results imply kinetic enhancement of SRS may be a concern in hohlraum plasmas for ICF experiments such as the National Ignition Facility.",

One of the most critical steps to reach this goal was increasing the power in the interferometer to more than 200 Watt at the beam splitter. This required the commissioning of both a thermal compensation system and shot noise limited sensing electronics capable of detecting all the light. Additionally, a series of unexpected noise sources had to be mitigated. This work is described in the first part of this thesis.

        "Abstrak": "Conducting polymers as a class of materials can be used to build a diverse range of devices. Conducting polymer based actuators (muscles), transistors (neurons), strain gages (muscle spindles), force sensors (Golgi tendon organs), light emitting diodes, photodetectors (eyes), batteries and supercapacitors (energy storage), and chemical sensors (noses) can all be manufactured. The range of behaviors makes conducting polymers the only class of materials that might be able to mimic the full range of functions needed to build a truly lifelike artificial system. In this thesis, a conducting polymer actuator and conducting polymer strain gage are used for the first time to build a reflex or position feedback loop that rejects position disturbances. The successful operation of the conducting polymer based reflex loop is an important step towards building an all polymer reflex loop that is directly integrated into a bulk material. Such a reflex loop could be used to control position, to control force or to dynamically change the material stiffness and viscosity. In the course of the project, an improved understanding of conducting polymer actuators has led to mathematical descriptions of the charging and discharging of long linear actuators and to equations describing the deflection and force of three layer bending beam actuators. These equations can be used as design tools to build actuators that satisfy given performance requirements. Finally, the performance of the actuators has been related to specific material properties to help direct research into new conducting polymeric materials.",

We carefully remove events that may exhibit non-statistical fluctuations due to other effects, such as event pileup and detector pathology. We also use very fine binning in the z and y vertex positions to eliminate fluctuations due to different event vertices. We eliminate global correlations within the dN/dn distributions by using a covariance matrix in the analysis, which is used to scale out correlations between difference pseduorapidity (n) regions. In the end we produce a value of x2 per degree of freedom (X2v ) for each event, which reflects how well the event agrees with the ensemble average. We compare this distribution with the distribution we would expect for a model using uncorrelated random variables with the same degrees of freedom of our system, and find remarkable agreement between our data and this random distribution. This allows us to conclude that most events in our data set are statistical fluctuations about the ensemble average. We are further able to determine that there is a signal of non-statistical events with X2V > 2.22, and that the rate of these events in the PHOBOS data is less than (1.97 ± 0.4(stat) O0.1(sys)) x 10-5 rare events/events.",

I begin by adding to the Hamiltonian of interest a symmetry breaking source term. Using time-dependent perturbation theory, I then expand the grand-canonical free energy as a double power series in both the tunneling and the source term. From here, an order parameter field is introduced, and the underlying effective action is derived via a Legendre transformation. After determining the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the effective action to first order in the tunneling term. expressions for the Mott insulator-superfluid phase boundary, condensate density, average particle number, and compressibility are derived and analyzed in detail. Additionally, excitation spectra in the ordered phase are found by considering both longitudinal and transverse variations of the order parameter. Finally, these results are applied to the concrete case of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a three dimensional cubic lattice, and compared with the corresponding results from mean-field theory. Although both approaches yield the same Mott insulator - superfluid phase boundary to first order in the tunneling, the predictions of the effective action theory turn out to be superior to the mean-field results deeper into the superfluid phase.",

Exploiting the slenderness of the film, we assume that the transverse fluid velocity is small compared to the longitudinal one and perform a perturbation expansion to obtain the leading order equations when the center-surface that defines the coordinate system is parametrized by lines of curvature.

In this thesis we study the spectral properties of Kähler manifolds assuming the existence of some symmetry, i.e., a Hamiltonian action. The main tool we will use is a function which we call the stability function. Roughly speaking, it is the function which compares quantum states before reduction with quantum states after reduction. We will study this function in detail, compute the function for many classes of Kähler manifolds, and apply it to study various spectral problems on Kähler quotients. As for the spectral measure, we will give an explicit way to compute the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion for toric varieties. It turns out that the upstairs spectral measure in this case is described by an interesting integral transform which we will call the twisted Mellin transform.

This difficulty disappears when working rationally, and we dualize Rector's construction of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence to produce a spectral sequence converging to the homotopy of a pushout. We use Gröbner-Shirshov bases, an analogue of Gröbner bases for free Lie algebras, to compute directly the E2 term for pushouts of wedges of spheres. In particular, for a cofiber sequence A --> X --> C where A and X are wedges of spheres, we use this calculations to generalize a result of Anick by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the map X --> C to be surjective in rational homotopy.

Thus, a challenge exists in designing materials suitable for supporting liver-derived cells that are not only biochemically hepatospecific but also biophysically sensitive to the mechanical nature of hepatocytes to achieve highly differentiated cell phenotype found in a natural liver. We employ a unique substrate material system of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) that can be tuned to achieve mechanical compliances of several orders of magnitudes (Es = 105 to Es = 108 Pa). We have shown that PEM modification can effectively change the surface mechanical compliance, and, thus, hepatocyte morphology and attachment, by looking at varying PEM pH deposition conditions (pH 2.0, 4.0, and 6.5) and collagen concentrations (0, 3, 10 ug/cm ) on different materials (tissue-culture polystyrene, polycarbonate, and Permanox). For all materials, PAH/PAA 4.0/4.0 provided the balance of cellular attachment that appeared neither confluent nor sparse while also promoting a natural hepatocyte phenotype.(cont.) We also observed that PEM films can effectively mask any inherent substrate material properties. Therefore, the use of PEM modification can be applied to a variety of surfaces and geometries for hepatocyte cultures. We believe that PEM is an invaluable tool in optimizing cellular attachment and function and will prove to be essential to future in vitro hepatocyte studies.",

The distinct intrinsic tendencies of sequence and structure profiles are most pronounced at long periods, where sequence hydrophobicity fluctuates less, while solvent accessibility fluctuates more than average. Correlations between the two profiles can be interpreted as the Boltzmann weight of the solvation energy at room temperature. Chapter 4 shows that correlations in solvent accessibility along protein structures play a key role in the designability phenomenon, for both lattice and natural proteins. Without such correlations, as predicted by the Random Energy Model (REM), all structures will have almost equal values of designability. By using a toy, Ising-based model, we show that changing the correlations moves between a regime with no designability and a regime exhibiting the designability phenomenon, where a few highly designable structures emerge. Understanding how gene expression is regulated is one of the main goals of molecular cell biology. To reach this goal, the recognition and identification of DNA motifs--short patterns in biological sequences--is essential. Common examples of motifs include transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions of co-regulated genes and exonic and intronic splicing enhancers ...In the past decade, a large amount of biological data has been generated, enabling new quantitative approaches in biology. In this thesis, we focus on two biological questions by using techniques from statistical physics: hydrophobicity patterns in proteins and their impact on the designability of protein structures and regulatory motif finding in DNA sequences. Proteins fold into specific structures to perform their functions. Hydrophobicity is the main force of folding; protein sequences try to lower the ground state energy of the folded structure by burying hydrophobic monomers in the core. This results in patterns, or correlations, in the hydrophobic profiles of proteins. In this thesis, we study the designability phenomena: the vast majority of proteins adopt only a small number of distinct folded structures. In Chapter 2, we use principal component analysis to characterize the distribution of solvent accessibility profiles in an appropriate high-dimensional vector space and show that the distribution can be approximated with a Gaussian form. We also show that structures with solvent accessibility profiles dissimilar to the rest are more likely to be highly designable, offering an alternative to existing, computationally-intensive methods for identifying highly-designable structures. In Chapter 3, we extend our method to natural proteins. We use Fourier analysis to study the solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity profiles of natural proteins and show that their distribution can be approximated by a multi-variate Gaussian. The method allows us to separate the intrinsic tendencies of sequence and structure profiles from the interactions that correlate them; we conclude that the alpha-helix periodicity in sequence hydrophobicity",

        "Abstrak": "Studies of international economic development often feature the competitive gains from inter-firm cooperation. By cooperating, firms within a region can draw on their collective resources and experience to test out new production processes and techniques; share the risks associated with system-wide upgrades and improvements; and identify and transition to more secure niche markets. What many development analysts and practitioners often forget, however, is that local economic actors do not always realize these benefits themselves, nor in unison. In recent times, sophisticated manufacturers have been known instead to employ less cooperative survival strategies, including disassociating themselves from their existing manufacturing base and especially from local colleagues with less training and experience. What then leads firms to work together and cooperate? This is the central question of this dissertation and case study of apparel manufacturing in Guadalajara, Mexico. Since the mid-1990s, a growing number of sophisticated, medium sized apparel makers in the region have been working with smaller sized, less experienced or barebones subcontractors and in the process, have established dynamic upgrading and learning alliances. Together these firms are having to \"unlearn\" an entrenched relational pattern based on strict production hierarchies and centralized forms of control; establish a new set of rules and routines that are more suitable for open learning and joint decision making; and finally, develop a shared \"identity\" around which to build out and legitimize their collective activities and experience.(cont.) In contrast to existing studies of craft manufacturing, success here does not come from established cultural norms or individual initiative and self-interest. Rather, it is a case in which three actors-from the state government, industry association and university extension center-have come together in an unexpected alliance to create the institutional structure and governance framework needed to support, guide and motivate this particular form of social learning and collective exchange. In describing the coordinated efforts of these three institutional actors, this case study not only provides planning lessons for other regions not \"born with the sprit to cooperate,\" but more importantly offers a set of policy guidelines for development practitioners wishing to keep skilled and well-connected manufacturers active and invested in their own communities.",

The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program was sold as a solution to a host of needs, from advancing the capabilities of each Service, modernizing an aging fleet, countering sophisticated threats, enhancing inter-service cooperation, and implementing acquisition reform, all in a revolutionarily cost-effective way. Because of this tantalizing promise, the early JSF program was able to navigate through budgetary pressures while other aircraft programs were cancelled. This thesis argues that the JSF program is a manifestation of a collective action problem, wherein stakeholders, who should be providing a check on each other, are cooperating, even as the stakeholder who should be participating, remains uninvolved. Consequently, the acquisition policies brought in with the JSF program are not improving acquisition policy, but are exacerbating the inefficiencies to which the U.S military acquisition system has historically been prone. This analysis provides insight into how to improve the technology policies governing military aircraft acquisition, and the supply of aircraft to other nations. This analysis is geared for senior policy makers in both government and industry, as well as those who guard the public interest.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis high resolution soft x-ray measurements from the Alcator C-Mod plasma edge are presented for a variety of different plasma conditions. These measurements provide radial profiles of the soft x-ray emissivity with 1.5 mm resolution or better, and temporal resolution down to 12 [mu]s. These profiles show a distinct and very narrow pedestal shape in H-mode, indicative of the H-mode transport barrier. The soft x-ray emissivity pedestal at the outboard edge is typically 10 mm inside the last closed flux surface, near the top of the electron density and temperature pedestals. Modelling shows that the inward shift of the x-ray pedestal implies an inward shift of the impurity density pedestal. This inward shift is explained by an inward impurity pinch located in the region of strong electron density gradient, as predicted by neoclassical impurity transport theory. Calculations using the impurity transport code MIST support the existence of a neoclassical-like inward pinch. Changes in the soft x-ray pedestal width can be interpreted as changes in the edge impurity diffusion coefficient. We find several scaling laws of the edge diffusion coefficient with various plasma parameters in EDA H-mode. A second array views the top of the plasma. The x-ray emissivity measured with this array also shows a distinct and narrow pedestal in H-mode. However, it is located significantly closer to the separatrix and is often narrower. Both of these differences increase with the safety factor at the edge, q95 . Thus, there is a significant poloidal asymmetry in the impurity density in the H-mode edge region, which increases with q95 . Therefore, the impurity transport in the H-mode edge is highly two-dimensional. The strong poloidal asymmetries measured show some quantitative agreement with theories developed to explain poloidal impurity asymmetries. However, none of the theories are strictly applicable to the Alcator C-Mod edge, and they all significantly underestimate the actual asymmetries that we observe.",

        "Abstrak": "The New Urbanist movement has grown considerably in the past decade in response to the impacts of sprawl in the United States. The crisis of sprawl has been caused in large part by poorly crafted land use regulations, many of which mandate sprawl. While an abundance of contemporary land use and planning literature focuses on the concepts of New Urbanism, little attention has been given to their regulatory implementation. And while developers and architects have responded to the problems of sprawl with plans for the development of new communities, few have looked at the opportunity to retrofit existing suburbs. This research adds to the field by illustrating how selected New Urbanist principles can be viably applied to residential infill developments in mature suburbs (specifically Greater Boston) if alternative regulations are adopted. Such development will not only preserve natural resources at the urban edge, but will ensure the efficiency and vitality of our mature core communities. Four developments in communities' representative of the Greater Boston region illustrate the contemporary (conventional) form of residential infill and two are given a post-mortem design alternative (New Urbanist). These alternative developments illustrate the viability of applying New Urbanist principles to residential infill in mature suburbs of Greater Boston. A model hamlet development regulation, used as a guide in developing the alternative designs, illustrates that:(cont.) 1. The application of New Urbanist principles to residential infill is a viable alternative to conventional sprawl development at the fringe of our mature communities; and 2. No drastic paradigm shift is necessary to implement the principles of New Urbanism in infill residential development. Even small changes to local land use regulations can afford significant improvements to the sustainability of our local land use regulations. The framework and results of this research are transferable to cities and towns across the Commonwealth and our nation. It is my hope that the principles and recommendations herein will be applied accordingly.",

        "Abstrak": "The optical properties of photonic crystals were studied to gain an understanding of the response of these structures to electromagnetic waves. In particular, multilayer films and two-dimensional systems were studied. It is known that multilayer films present omnidirectional reflectivity for a certain range of frequencies. A numerical technique for solving the Maxwell's equations within infinite periodic structures is presented. The media are assumed to be isotropic, linear, and non-conducting. This technique is based on the Fourier Transform of the dielectric constant of the structure. The numerical formulation allows the determination of the dispersion curves for photonic crystals. From them, omnidirectional reflectivity can be studied. The formulation was used to find the range of forbidden frequencies within an infinite multilayer film composed of two alternating materials. The energy gap for several constitutive parameters is shown. A two-dimensional system composed of infinite rods in a square lattice was also treated with this method. The Matrix Translation Method for studying omnidirectional reflectivity in one-dimensional systems was also used. This method considers homogeneous media and the electromagnetic fields are matched at the interfaces between the media. The formulation is used to obtain the reflectivity of the multilayer film as a function of the direction and frequency of the incident wave. By taking into account all directions and frequencies, omnidirectionality can be found. The method was applied to a finite multilayer film and the results are compared to those obtained with the Fast Fourier Transform Method. Similar results were obtained. An understanding of the properties of photonic crystals was achieved and guidelines for the determination of energy gaps are presented.",

        "Abstrak": "Urban sanitation systems are fundamental elements of modern urban development. Decentralized, privately operated, on-site wastewater disposal systems have also played an important role in suburban and exurban development over the past fifty years. This research is an attempt to assess the current influence of on-site wastewater disposal technology and regulations on land use patterns in Norfolk County, Massachusetts; to estimate the potential impacts of technological and regulatory change; and to assess the potential role of on-site sanitation policies in managing suburban and exurban development. I grouped soil types into seven interpretive classes based on their limitations for wastewater disposal; and created a Soil Development Index, which represents the relative proportion of soil classes in available and developed land over time. I found that soils with high groundwater and slow permeability are systematically underrepresented in residential development utilizing on-site wastewater disposal; comparisons to sewer service areas suggest these patterns may be due to regulatory restrictions on the use of septic systems. Slowly permeable soils and shallow bedrock areas are also associated with larger lot sizes in unsewered areas. The land-consumptive patterns of development observed in unsewered suburbs suggest that the current system of on-site sanitation is closely linked to other public policies that promote large-lot single family large-lot development to the exclusion of more diverse development models. The history of centralized and decentralized sanitation systems in the United States demonstrates that sanitation policies have evolved over time to address a wider variety of social and political concerns, including explicit planning objectives. Additional research is necessary to assess how sanitation policies -- including standards for on-site wastewater disposal -- might be used as implementation mechanisms for land use and planning policies intended to promote sustainability",

        "Abstrak": "The effect of sulfur on the corrosion fatigue crack growth of austenitic stainless steel was evaluated under Light Water Reactor (LWR) conditions of 288°C deaerated (less than 5ppb O₂) water, to shed light on the accelerating effect of the LWR environment and to explore the effect of high sulfur content on the retardation of fatigue crack growth rates. Fatigue tests were performed using a trapezoidal loading pattern with rise times of 5.1, 51, 510, and 5100 seconds (fall time of 0.9, 9, 90, and 900 seconds), with Kmzx of 28.6 or 31.9 MPa[mathematical symbol]m and stress ratios (R, Pmin/Pmax) of 0.4 or 0.7. Two test materials were used to evaluate the effect of sulfur: (1) a low sulfur (<0.0025 wt%) stainless steel and, (2) a high sulfur (0.032 wt% stainless steel. The low sulfur stainless steel exhibited increasing crack growth rates from 9.4 x10-5 mm/cycle to 1.2x1 0-⁴ mm/cycle as rise times were increased from 5.1 to 5100 seconds with a stress ratio of 0.7. The high sulfur stainless steel exhibited decreasing crack growth rates from 1.4 x10-⁴ mm/cycle to 7.9 x10-⁵ mm/cycle as rise times were increased for a stress ratio of 0.4, and crack growth rates from 6.4 x10 5 mm/cycle to 3.6 x10-⁵ mm/cycle with increasing rise time at a stress ratio of 0.7. Evaluation of the crack growth rates showed environmental enhancement of the crack growth rates for the low sulfur stainless steel, while the high sulfur stainless steel showed retardation of environmental crack growth rates, likely due to the increased corrosion at the crack tip associated with the high sulfur content. The crack surfaces were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The low sulfur material showed a light layer of corrosion product that decreased in thickness as the testing progressed, and faceting on the surface was highly crystallographic. Faceting ran both perpendicular and parallel to the crack for the short rise time steps of the test, but fewer perpendicular facets were evident at the longer rise times. The high sulfur material was heavily corroded throughout the fracture surface, and crystallographic faceting was seen for stages of the test with R=0.4 For R=0.7, the heavy oxidation on the surface made the facets hard to resolve. Striations were apparent during the 5100 second rise time for the low sulfur material (where corrosion was almost nonexistent) and throughout the entirety of the crack surface for the high sulfur material. Materials were also characterized by optical microscopy. The low sulfur material showed pitting along the grain boundaries, due to the boron concentration in this material, which resulted in boron precipitates, while the high sulfur material showed pitting throughout the surface, due to the MnS inclusions. Electrochemical tests were also performed at room temperature on both materials in pH 4 (using H₂SO₄), 7, and 10 (using NH₄OH). Peaks in the passive region of the high sulfur material were seen at potentials of 160, 630, and 1400 mVSHE, due to dissolution of the MnS inclusions. The results suggest that the high sulfur material provides an increase in corrosion when exposed to the environment, which leads to the retardation of crack growth rates at the longer rise times due to prolonged exposure of the crack tip to the environment. At low stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation of crack growth rates is crack tip closure, due to a buildup of corrosion product at the fracture surface, which lowers the effective load that the crack tip experiences. At high stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation is an increased in injected vacancies and enhanced creep, which disrupt the slip bands ahead of the crack tip, reducing the crack tip stresses. Fractography of the fracture surface and crack growth rate comparisons of the low and high sulfur material provide supportive evidence for the proposed mechanisms, and further work is proposed to examine the effect of increased corrosion ahead of the crack tip.",

        "Abstrak": "The goal of this work is to understand the properties of mixed-metal intercalation oxides. Using first-principles methods, the effect of doping on the mixing, energetic, and voltage properties as well as the phase diagrams of lithium transition-metal oxides for lithium battery cathode materials was investigated. The effect of doping on the phase separation tendencies of layered transition-metal oxides was examined and it was found that for normal processing temperatures, Al is miscible in layered transition metal oxides (LiMO2) for five of the eight first-row transition metals studied. Temperature-composition phase diagrams for both Li(Al,Co)O2 and Li(Al,Cr)O2 were calculated. In these two systems, Al-doping is limited above 600°C by the formation of [gamma]-LiA1O2 and at very low temperatures owing to the existence of a miscibility gap. Reduced solubility is expected in the layered phase above 600°C for all oxides which have substantial solubility with LiA1O2 due to the formation of yLiAlO2. The effect of transition-metal doping on the average voltage properties in Mn-based spinets was calculated and the large increase in average voltage found experimentally was reproduced. A detailed analysis on the layered structure Li(Al,Co)O2 was performed, studying the energetics of different lithium sites and the effect of short-range clustering on the shape of the voltage curve. Though the average voltage is raised by Al substitution, the unexpected stability of sites with a few Al nearest neighbors leads to an initial decrease in voltage. For the Al-doped LiCoO2 system, a step in the voltage curve is found only for micro-segregated materials. When the Al and Co ions are randomly distributed in a solid solution, the voltage curve shows a continuous, gradual slope. The effect of oxygen defects in the Li(Al,Co)O2 system was investigated. A model for the effect of oxygen vacancies on the free energy of doped layered oxides was created by combining an ideal gas approximation and first-principles energy defect calculations. The results qualitatively confirm experimental studies on oxygen release in lithium battery materials.",

However, the relative tax advantage of different forms of pay was small during this period. Using a sample of top executives in large firms from 1946 to 2005, we also find a small short run response of salaries, qualified stock options, and bonuses paid after retirement to changes in tax rates on labor income--even though tax rates were significantly higher and more heterogeneous across individuals in the first several decades following WWII. We explore several potential explanations for the conflicting impressions given by the long-run and short-run correlations between taxes and pay, including changes in social norms and concerns about pay equality.",

However, the mechanism of action for these vaccines remained unclear, as LCMPs are too large to drain efficiently to lymph nodes from the vaccination site. Here, we characterized the stability of the lipid envelope of LCMPs and discovered that in the presence of serum the lipid coating of the particles spontaneously delaminates, shedding antigen-displaying vesicles. Lipid delamination generated 180 nm liposomes in a temperature- and lipid/serum-dependent manner. Vesicle shedding was restricted by inclusion of high-T[subscript M] lipids or cholesterol in the LCMP coating. Administration of LCMPs bearing stabilized lipid envelopes generated weaker antibody responses than those of shedding-competent LCMPs, suggesting that in situ release of antigen-loaded vesicles plays a key role in the remarkable potency of LCMPs as vaccine adjuvants.",

High-speed video and pyrometry allowed the study of phase selection and secondary nucleation mechanisms for that alloy as well as measurements of delay times and growth velocities.  Double recalescence events were observed for the first time at temperatures near the To temperature of the metastable ferritic phase, defining a value of the critical undercooling for metastable bee nucleation significantly lower than previously reported. Phase selection during recalescence was successfully performed by use of different trigger materials: at temperatures below the bee To , a bee Fe trigger induced the primary nucleation of the metastable bee phase which subsequently transformed into the stable fee phase while an fee Ni trigger caused the nucleation of the equilibrium fee phase.  Growth velocities were characterized for the 6 phase growing into the undercooled liquid, the [delta] phase growing into the undercooled liquid and the [gamma] phase growing into the semi-solid primary bee. It was found that a critical undercooling exists at which the growth velocity of the primary ferritic phase is equal to that of the secondary austenitic phase into the primary semi-solid. At undercoolings below this critical value, the equilibrium, can overwhelm the primary a and break into the undercooled liquid. Such a double recalescence event can therefore appear as a single event depending on the geometry of the detection equipment. From this observation, a model based on velocity and delay time arguments was proposed to explain discrepancies with earlier works.",

        "Abstrak": "In recent years branes have had significant impact in the construction of higher dimensional theories of SUSY breaking, and of gravitational phenomena. In particular they provide strong motivation for considering anomaly mediation as a mechanism of SUSY breaking communication. Anomaly mediation provides a very predictive spectrum for the superpartner masses, which is quite model independent, and is given in terms of the beta functions and anomalous dimensions of the fields. This spectrum is also largely flavor blind, and thus does not suffer from flavor changing neutral current problems. Anomaly mediation, however, predicts negative slepton mass squardes. In this thesis we will try to address this problem by providing positive contributions to the slepton masses, through higher order SUSY breaking effects stemming from having additional heavy fields in the theory. We will also provide natural values for the Au and B parameters of the MSSM. Branes also allow for the surprising possibility that we may be living in a world with infinite extra dimensions with minor observational consequences. In this dissertation we will show that the RS2 and LR models, which have a single infinite dimension, are completely consistent and conform nicely with current experiments. We will also comment on possible holographic interpretations of these models as having 4D gravity coupled to a fully quantum conformal field theory.",

After reviewing background material on D-branes and orbifolds, along with some mathematical fundamentals, I describe the following results. First, a classification of discrete torsion for a large class of orbifolds and a technique for extracting the matter content of D-brane probe gauge theories on orbifolds with discrete torsion. Subsequently, I discuss an algorithm, called stepwise projection, that illuminates the structure of the so-called exceptional quivers, and hints towards the brane realization of the associated gauge theories. Next, I present the computation of the partition function of the coset conformal field theory describing the two-dimensional black hole. This computation confirms earlier results concerning the spectrum of the black hole and it enable us to identify the physical Hilbert space. This theory appears in the exact string theory description of configurations of Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes and in the conformal field theory description of certain orbifolds in singular limits; thus, it is only a mild digression from the main theme of the thesis. This is not so, however, for the last topic discussed here. We will change gears completely and discuss our extension of Witten's construction of boundary string field theory to the superstring. As in the bosonic case, the main tool we use is the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Our construction proves a recent conjecture regarding the spacetime action of the supersymmetric theory and a related conjecture concerning quantum field theories on two-dimensional spaces with boundaries.",

In this paper we report methods of synthesizing new potential catalysts with the general formula M(NR)(CHR′)(OR″)(Cl)(L) in which M = Mo or W, NR = N-2,6-diisopropylphenyl or NC6F5, and L is a phosphine, a pyridine, or a nitrile. We also test and compare all catalysts in the cross-metathesis of Z-1,2-dichloroethylene and cyclooctene. Our investigations indicate that tungsten complexes are inactive in the test reaction either because the donor is bound too strongly or because acetonitrile inserts into a W═C bond. The acetonitrile or pivalonitrile Mo(NR)(CHR′)(OR″)(Cl)(L) complexes are found to be especially reactive because the 14e Mo(NR)(CHR′)(OR″)Cl core is accessible through dissociation of the nitrile to a significant extent. Pivalonitrile can be removed (>95%) from Mo(NAr)(CHCMe₂Ph)(OHMT)(Cl)(t-BuCN) (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl; OHMT = 2,6-dimesitylphenoxide) to give 14e Mo(NAr)(CHCMe₂Ph)(OHMT)Cl in solution as a mixture of syn and anti (60:40 at 0.015 M) nitrile-free isomers, but these 14e complexes have not yet been isolated in pure form. The syn isomer of Mo(NAr)(CHCMe₂Ph)(OHMT)Cl binds pivalonitrile most strongly. Other Mo(NR)(CHR′)(OR″)(Cl)(L) complexes can be activated through addition of B(C₆F₅)₃. High stereoselectivities (>98% Z,Z) of ClCH═CH(CH₂)₆CH═CHCl are not restricted to tert-butylimido or adamantylimido complexes; 96.2% Z selectivity is observed with boron-activated Mo(NC₆F₅)(CHR′)(OHIPT)(Cl)(PPhMe₂).

In the two decades since, the industry has grown from nothing to $50 Billion in revenue. In the beginning, freight brokers used T-card systems to record, track, and bill orders. Technology advances over those two decades have driven many of the operational changes throughout the freight transportation industry as a whole, with shipment data visibility, asset utilization, and supply chain planning leading the way. The use of optimization tools in transportation and supply chain management has proliferated. Network analysis, inventory planning and deployment, fleet routing, and warehouse planning are important examples of areas in which these tools have had a major impact. However, the freight brokerage sub-industry itself has largely ignored the use of these tools. This research proposes pragmatic uses for optimization techniques in the freight brokerage industry.

        "Abstrak": "A myriad of electronic retailers are contending in a battle to guard their established territories in cyberspace. Many of them are desperately searching for the key to sustainable growth and profitability as the struggle continues and intensifies. This study finds that one powerful way to attract customers in the e-commerce industry is to create \"stickiness\" through virtual communities and personalization. Virtual communities and personalization have become necessary elements for a successful e-business as they provide extended customer relations. The two cannot be easily imitated by rivals, creating sustainable competitive advantages. This paper substantiates the above claims in many approaches. First, the literature review will provide information to understand the importance of virtual communities and personalization. A dynamic feedback model is then presented to show how the two factors interact to develop a solid loyal customer base. Next, results of multivariate regression analysis using General Social Surveys 1972-2000 further justify the claim that virtual communities and personalization have significant positive effects on individuals' online purchase behavior. This empirical work also show that demographic variables are not correlated with the probability of making online purchases. Finally, case studies of leading e-commerce firms are presented to confirm that electronic retailers effectively managing virtual communities and offering personalized services are rewarded with customer loyalty, impressive growth, and above industry-average profit returns.",

        "Abstrak": "Consumer demand is hard to predict in any industry, let alone the automotive industry. Vehicle manufacturers try to produce according to what their customers want, but if these wants change, the company is faced with lots of unsold cars and a huge changeover cost. In order to help fight the problems of demand variability, automotive manufacturers have begun the move towards plant flexibility. This includes designing vehicles comprised of similar subassemblies and the development of flexible tooling. The hope is that multiple vehicles can be produced on the same line so if demand starts to fluctuate, they can change the production levels of their styles with minimal lead time. There are a number of different approaches to flexible tooling. One approach using programmable robotic repositionable tools (PRRT) is particularly promising because it can handle a large number of styles and requires low style specific reinvestment costs. This thesis examines the PRRT technology as well as other forms of flexible tooling to understand the conditions under which these approaches make the most economic sense.(cont.) For this project an algorithm was developed to choose assembly tools based on subassembly characteristics, production levels, style counts, and flexibility approaches. The algorithm was connected to an already existing vehicle assembly model and two forms of economic analysis were performed. The first looked at the costs of using PRRT versus other forms of tooling for various product mixes. The second analyzed the potential cost savings when considering product changeover. The results indicated that the initial outlays for PRRTs cannot be justified even for a large number of styles unless multi-generational product changeover is also considered. However, PRRTs provide a cost effective flexible tooling option for plants producing multiple styles when considering product changeovers.",

Despite the environmentally beneficial advantages of biomass waste to olefins technology, the economic advantages or disadvantages still need to be explored further. This thesis tries to determine under what operating conditions (production volumes, feedstock prices, etc.) make the biomass waste to olefins technology most competitive. The WTM process is the economical limiting factor in the WTO technology.

Since it has been demonstrated that AFM could be used in aqueous environment such as in water or various buffers from which physiological condition can be maintained, the scope of the application of this imaging technique has been expanded to soft biological materials. In addition, the main usage of AFM has been to image the material and provide the shape of surface, which has also been diversified to molecular-recognition imaging - functional force imaging through force spectroscopy and modification of AFM cantilevers. By immobilizing of certain molecules at the end of AFM cantilever, specific molecules or functionalities can be detected by the combination of intrinsic feature of AFM and chemical modification technique of AFM cantilever. The surface molecule that is complementary to the molecule at the end of AFM probe can be investigated via specificity of molecule-molecule interaction.(cont.) Thus, this AFM cantilever chemistry, or chemical functionalization of AFM cantilever for the purpose of chemomechanical surface characterization, can be considered as an infinite source of applications important to understanding biological materials and material interactions.

Its biomechanical integrity is crucial for maintaining a healthy gestation and a successful delivery. The premature rupture of the fetal membrane (PROM) can result in serious perinatal complications. Despite extensive research in this field, the mechanical and biochemical processes governing the membrane deformation and failure remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to characterize the mechanical behavior of the chorioamnionic tissue along with its biochemical properties, through mechanical testing and biochemical analyses. In order to accomplish this goal, specific mechanical and biochemical testing protocols were developed. In vitro mechanical testing was performed on samples from seven patients under different uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. Significant relaxation was noted under uniaxial loading while very limited creep was observed under biaxial loading. Biochemical measurements such as collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycan contents were also obtained. In addition, a microstructurally based constitutive model for the fetal membrane is proposed.(cont.) The model allows for nonlinear hyperelastic response at large deformation. We also propose a framework to capture the time-dependent response of the tissue. The model was implemented in a finite element formulation to allow three-dimensional simulations of membrane deformation.",

Research revealed that the recirculating fans drew the most energy and were continuously running on full power. If the fans were turned down during off peak times the consumption of electricity could be decreased by as much as approximately 26% and save the Institute $250,000 a year in electrical costs.",

A case study on a robotic control problem shows that feature-based basis functions are very effective because they are able to capture the characteristics and cost structure of the problem. State-space partitioning, polynomials and other non-linear combinations of state parameters are also used in the ALP. However, design of these basis functions requires more trial-and-error. Simulation results show that control policy generated by the approximate linear programming algorithm matches and sometimes surpasses that of heuristics. Moreover, optimal policies are found well before value function estimates reach optimality. The ALP scales well with problem size and the number of basis functions required to find the optimal policy does not increase significantly in larger scale systems. The promising results shed light on the possibility of applying approximate linear programming to other large-scale problems that are computationally intractable using traditional dynamic programming methods.",

Since the 1960's, the best thermoelectric material has been Bi2Te3 alloys, with a ZT of 1.0 at a temperature ofT = 300 K. The advancement of nano-scale technologies has opened up the possibility of engineering materials at nano-scale dimensions to achieve low-dimensional thermoelectric structures which may be superior to their bulk forms. In this thesis, I established the basis of the low dimensional thermoelectric transport principle in the Si/Si1-xGex quantum well superlattice (two-dimensional) system and in the Bi quantum wire (one-dimensional) system. In bulk form, Si1_xGex is a promising thermoelectric material for high temperature applications. The Si/Si1 _xGex quantum well superlattice structures are studied based on their electronic band structures using semiclassical transport theory. Detailed subband structures are considered in an infinite series of finite height quantum wells and barriers. A significant enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit is expected. Based on my calculations, experimental studies are designed and performed on MBE grown Si/Sii -xGex quantum well superlattice structures. The experimental results are found to be consistent with theoretical predictions and indicate a significant enhancement of Z within the quantum wells over bulk values. The bismuth quantum wire system is a one-dimensional (ID) thermoelectric system. Bismuth as a semimetal is not a good thermoelectric material in bulk form becamm of the approximate cancellation between the electron and hole contributions to the Seebeck coefficient. However, quantum confinement can be introduced by making Bi nanowires to yield a ID semiconductor. ID transport properties are calculated along the principal crystallographic directions. By carefully tailoring the Bi wire size and carrier concentration, substantial enhancement in Z is expected. A preliminary experimental study of Bi nanowire arrays is also presented.",

We have produced experiments to study this transition in a controlled fashion. One probes the spatial extent of electronic wave functions by investing the dependence of these energies on changes in the dot confirming potential We find that for low electron densities, electrons occupy distinct spatial sites localized within the dot At higher densities, the electrons become delocalized, and all wavefuncions are spread over the full dot area The transition occurs around the critical electron density n0 = 1 x 1011cm-2 For densities Just below the critical density our data establish the existence of electronic states localized at the dot's periphery We also create a dot with a potential profile containing two minimal separated by a barrier. Our studies conclusively demonstrate that under precisely the same conditions for observation of the paired electron additions, a low-density electron droplet inside the dot indeed splits up into smaller fragments, each resigning a disorder minimum We find that the two electrons added as a pair actually enter into spatially-distinct regions within a dot and we measure the remnant residual interact between the fragments Surprisingly, it displays nearly complete independence on the strength of the applied field for fields larger than required for the localization transition.",

The detailed design of one of its modules, the enclosure module, is the subject of this paper. The Endoblend has the potential to reduce morcellation surgery time from upwards of half an hour to minutes, with reduced risk of the most common complications of nicking the abdomen wall and leaving tissue behind. There are three primary functional requirements of the enclosure module. First, for ease of use, simplicity, and safety the bag and guard in combination must passively feed the tissue into the blades. This was accomplished using, a cone shape to make the bottom of the bag act as an equilibrium state through a gravity feed. Second, the bag must remain intact to prevent tissue from being left behind. To accomplish this it will be shaped with a flat region near the blades so that inflating the bag keeps it away from the blades, and the Ziploc type seal through which the tissue enters will be a double seal with micro beads of cyanocrolate to make a strong permanent seal.(cont.) Third, since the main benefit of the Endoblend is shorter surgery time, it is vital that the extra steps incurred from use of the enclosure module do not take up a significant portion of the time saved by its rapid tissue processing capabilities. The prototype bag met these functional requirements, and was used to successfully process tissue in a bench-top experiment. The successful design and integration of the enclosure module will allow this project to continue moving forward. This thesis along with the thesis on the guard answered the remaining critical questions that preceded putting together a next iteration prototype to use in order to perform animal tests.",

Experimental investigations were conducted that utilized the rotor-oscillator flow to drive low Reynolds number quasi-periodic and aperiodic flows. Flow separation was observed using flow visualization techniques that employed fluorescent dye. These experimental investigations show the existence of fixed separation in both quasi-periodic and aperiodic flows. The experimental results also suggest that the location of fixed separation is immune to relatively quick variations in the flow. Thus, the 'typical' behavior of a quasi-periodic or aperiodic flow dictates the location of fixed separation in addition to the amplitude of oscillation of the flow. Both of these findings imply that the time averaged zero skin friction point is a stronger predictor of separation, which supports the Haller (2004) criteria. Furthermore, while still premature, the experimental results have so far been corroborated by early numerical simulations of the Haller (2004) criteria in the quasi-periodic flows investigated in this study.",

Number of cells can be indirectly assessed by measuring total protein or RNA levels when direct counting is problematic.

The first experiment asked subjects to wear the tactile display and walk while responding to signals. The results indicated that most of the subjects were able to recognize the patterns. The overall mean correct response rate was 92% and then when the subjects were asked to jog, they correctly identified the patterns 91% of the time.

The data from this experiment had an overall mean correct response rate of 93%. The results from this experiment further indicate that subjects can still receive communications while participating in other activities. The results also lead to specific conclusions about the patterns used and their ability to be identified with concurrent activity where some patterns are more easily received than others.

Then, I applied this method to two design scenarios, a mid-sole for a running shoe and a prosthetic socket for trans-tibial amputees. The thesis details the design workflow from computational data driven design to the fabrication of low-cost functionally graded material systems.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis describes a study of a cavity QED microlaser in which many atoms are present simultaneously and atom-cavity interaction is well-defined. The microlaser is found to display multiple thresholds analogous to first-order phase transitions of the cavity field. Hysteresis is observed as a function of atom-cavity detuning and number of atoms. Data is compared with a rate equation model and fully quantized treatment based on micromaser theory. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found when the cavity is resonant with atoms of the most probable velocity, but long lifetimes of metastable states preclude the observation of true steady-state transition points. For nonzero atom-cavity detuning the microlaser displays broadenings and shifts which are not yet well-understood. Quantum trajectory simulations are performed to investigate many-atom and finite transit time effects in the microlaser. We show that over a wide range of parameters the many-atom microlaser scales with the single-atom theory, with a perturbation in the photon statistics due to cavity decay during the atom transit time.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, we present some results that strongly support Sen's conjectures on tachyon condensation on a bosonic D-brane. Our main tool of analysis is level truncated open bosonic string field theory We use level truncation to check that the energy difference between the local maximum and the local minimum of the open bosonic tachyon effective potential is equal to the tension of a space-filling D-brane (Sen's first conjecture). Our results prove this equality within a precision of about 0.1%. We then construct lump solutions of open bosonic string field theory, which are conjectured by Sen (third conjecture) to be D-branes of lower dimensions. We check that indeed the tensions of lumps of codimension one and two, coincide with the tensions of the respective D-branes within a precision of a few percent. We also give evidence for Sen's second conjecture; that in the nonperturbative tachyon vacuum all open string degrees of freedom must disappear. We show that this is guaranteed if we can write the identity string field I in the form I = QA, where A is some string field and Q is the BRST operator in the true vacuum. We show evidence that the identity can indeed be written in this form. We also analyze the dynamics of tachyon condensation by studying time-dependent solutions of p-adic string theory and level truncated string field theory. Although our rolling solutions conserve energy, their pressure oscillates with diverging amplitudes. These results therefore don't support Sen's proposal of a pressureless tachyon matter.",

We view this problem from two perspectives and compare their advantages. In the multicommodity flow formulation, a solution provides dedicated bandwidth r between each source-sink pair. In the information flow formulation, a vertex can transmit a function of the information it received thereby allowing multiple source-sink pairs to share bandwidth. For directed acyclic graphs with n vertices, we show that the rate achievable in the information flow formulation can be a multiplicative factor n larger than the rate achievable in the multicommodity flow formulation. It is well known [5] that for undirected graphs with n vertices, in the multicommodity flow formulation, the maximum rate achievable can be an O(1/log|V|) multiplicative factor smaller than the value of the sparsest cut. We extend this result to show that the maximum rate achievable in the information flow setting can be an O(1/log|V|) multiplicative factor smaller than the sparsest cut value.For directed acyclic graphs G, we define a parameter called the value of the most meager cut which is an upper bound for the maximum rate achievable in the information flow setting.We also present an example illustrating that this upper bound is not always tight.",

Its purpose is to find the relationship between transportation cost and the level of service in cold chain transportation. Regression models are built to quantify the additional cost of superior quality cold chain for both Chiquita and its carriers, and analyze the relationship between such cost and customer service level. In order to guarantee the freshness of salads and fruits, cold chain transportation has to meet strict quality standards and additional costs occur due to efforts required to maintain and monitor the transportation performance. The thesis takes quantitative approach to demonstrate the relationships among the quality standards required, the cost associated, and the customer service level reached. The temperature quality standards are mainly measured by monitoring data from RFID monitor Sensitech. The cost data are collected from Chiquita's historical carrier rates. The customer service level is measured in two dimensions, on time drop-off, and on time pick-up. The thesis also takes qualitative approach by a survey on carriers' additional cost of offering superior cold chain transportation among Chiquita's carriers. No correlation is found between transportation cost and the level of service in cold chain transportation. Therefore carriers with best cold chain management don't necessarily charge the highest.",

In particular, we introduce \"smarter\" cuts into two general methods for solving these problems. These cuts utilize second order information on the problem through the use of a gap function. We establish convergence results for both methods, as well as complexity results for one of the methods. Finally, we compare the performance of an approach that combines affine scaling and cutting plane methods with other methods for solving variational inequalities. The second part of the thesis considers a supply chain setting where several capacitated suppliers compete for orders from a single retailer in a multi-period environment. At each period the retailer places orders to the suppliers in response to the prices and capacities they announce. Our model allows the retailer to carry inventory. Furthermore, suppliers can expand their capacity at an additional cost; the retailer faces exogenous, price-dependent, stochastic demand. We analyze discrete as well as continuous time versions of the model: (i) we illustrate the existence of equilibrium policies; (ii) we characterize the structure of these policies; (iii) we consider coordination mechanisms; and (iv) we present some computational results. We also consider a modified model that uses option contracts and finally present some extensions.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, we investigated the mechanical behavior of small volume structures, with specific application to thin metal films and patterned metal lines on substrates. The first part of this investigation dealt with the elastoplastic behavior of interconnect lines during thermal cycling. A robust computational method was developed to predict volume-averaged stresses in unpassivated and passivated lines in response to changes in temperature, as a function of line geometry, material properties and thermal history. The computational model also facilitated the extraction of substrate curvature. In addition, a simple analytical method was developed to allow extraction of volume-averaged stresses in unpassivated lines upon yielding due to thermal stresses, via experimental curvature methods. The second part of the investigation involved the systematic nanoindentation of a wide range of FCC single crystals and polycrystals, in bulk and thin film form. For shallow (</= 100 nm) depths, the experimentally obtained P-h curves displayed elastic loading portions alternated with inelastic displacement bursts, for all specimens. The bursts were attributed to dislocation nucleation and motion within the crystal, which occurred when stresses underneath the indenter tip approached the critical shear strength of the material. Theories of dislocation activity were confirmed with planar TEM photos of nanoindented Cu films. In order to examine the atomistics of such phenomena, an experimental 2-D atomic simulation was developed, via an extension of the classical soap bubble raft, to simulate elastic contact and defect nucleation at low loads. Dislocation nucleation inside crystals of low defect density, ostensibly requiring stresses on the order of the theoretical shear strength, was found to occur under blunt indenters, providing a mechanistic justification for bursts observed during nanoindentation experiments. Finally, the experimental nanoindentation results for thin films were analyzed in the context of elastoplastic indentation, incorporating elastic loading and inelastic bursts. Stiffnesses thus obtained were found to increase as film thickness decreased, displaying a similar trend to literature thin film strength values obtained via substrate curvature methods.",

        "Abstrak": "Ozone formation is a complex, non-linear process that depends on the atmospheric concentrations of its precursors, nitrogen oxide (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), as well as on temperature and the available amount of sunlight. The dependence of ozone formation on meteorology makes the timing of emissions important, suggesting the need for a temporally differentiated regulation for NOx emissions. Such a flexible NOx regulation policy, so-called \"smart trading\", which is designed to target ozone episodes by reducing NOx emissions prior to and during forecasted episodes, has the potential for reducing the compliance cost and helping to solve the persistent ozone non-attainment problem in the Eastern United States. However, the total compliance cost of this new policy depends critically on the accuracy of ozone forecasting. This thesis aims to address the question of whether a NOx trading program that differentiates across emissions by time could reduce ozone concentrations more cost-effectively than the conventional command-and-control method in the Eastern U.S. given the uncertainty in ozone forecasting. A cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted to compare the average cost for achieving a certain amount of ozone reduction under the proposed smart trading plan and the command-and-control policy. The probability distribution of the compliance cost under a smart trading policy is simulated using a stochastic decision model based on the simulated electricity generation and air quality data.(cont.) This study demonstrates the scientific and economic feasibility of a time-differentiated trading scheme. I explore whether such a regulatory design is justifiable with respect to ozone forecast accuracy by conducting sensitivity analysis of ozone prediction errors and discover that uncertainty in ozone forecasting may not be a major limiting factor for the feasibility of a time-differentiated NOx cap-and-trade program.",

The concept is not new and has been used since last seven decades to understand cost walk down in various industries. The seminal works defined learning in a narrower sense to encompass reduction in man hours as a result of learning. The work done later expanded this concept to include suppliers, long term contracts, management and some other economic and technological factors. But the basic mechanism in all these study was to look at manufacturing cost in an aggregate sense and use the past data to predict the cost walk down in future. In the present work the focus has shifted from looking at cost in an aggregate manner and understanding it more at a manufacturing level using process based cost modeling. This would give a new perspective to the age old problem of cost evolution. Besides it would also give the line engineers and managers a better insight into the levers which eventually lead to cost reduction at manufacturing level. This is achieved by using learning curves to define the manufacturing parameters based on previous observations. The work further looks at cost evolution for new and non-existent technology for which historic data does not exist. This is achieved by building a taxonomic classification of industry based on certain parameters which can be easily guessed.",

An Optimality-Theoretic analysis is sketched in which the output of the ALIGN-Sphere process is filtered by various phonetic constraints and may be replaced by an alternative form that does not otherwise violate phonetic constraints. The model outlined above leads to a new typology of signs: first there are spatial verbs, followed by plain verbs which do not have two animate arguments, followed by aligning verbs which by definition have two animate arguments. These aligning verbs contain a subset of verbs that are in theory capable of undergoing ALIGN-Sphere without violating phonetic constraints. This subset in turn contains another subset of verbs that are listed as actually undergoing ALIGN-Sphere in a particular language. The model rests on the assumption that the referential use of space lies outside of the grammar. By removing the referential space from the grammar removes the modality difference between spoken and signed languages with respect to 'agreement.' The remaining differences will lie in how agreement is implemented, but that is no longer a modality difference. Both spoken and signed languages make use of different processes within the morphology component to generate the agreement system (e.g. impoverishment, vocabulary insertion, and phonological re-adjustment rules), but otherwise they draw on the same set of processes made available by the grammar.",

In the thesis we prove that if the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times ... then the curvature tensor has to be uniformly bounded as well. In particular, this means that if the Ricci tensor stays uniformly bounded up to a finite time T, a Ricci flow can not develop a singularity at T. We will give two different proofs of that result. One of them relies on Hamilton's estimates on distance changes along the flow and the other one relies on the identities for reduced distances and the monotonicity formula for reduced volumes that has been introduced and proved by Perelman in [29]. Consider the Ricci flow ... on a closed, n-dimensional manifold M. Assume that a solution of the flow exists for all times ... and that the curvatures and the diameters are uniformly bounded along the flow. We will prove that for every sequence ... there exists a subsequence such that g(ti + t) converges to a metric h(t) and h(t) is a Ricci soliton. We will also prove that if one of the limit solitons is integrable, then a soliton that we get in the limit is unique up to diffeomorphisms and the convergence toward it is exponential.(cont.) We will also prove that in an arbitrary dimension, for a given Kähler-Ricci flow with uniformly bounded Ricci curvatures, for every sequence of times ti converging to infinity, there exists a subsequence such that ... and the convergence is smooth outside a singular set (which is a set of codimension at least 4). Moreover, g(t) is a solution of the flow off the singular set. In the case of a complex dimension 2, for any sequence of times converging to infinity we can find a subsequence of times such that we have a convergence toward a Kähler-Ricci soliton, away from finitely many isolated singularities.",

In that future, a patient could have his entire sequence of DNA screened for mutations that cause or predispose him to disease, and health care would be truly individualized to fit the genetic profile of each patient. But science isn't yet able to make this future a reality; DNA sequencing remains too time-consuming and expensive to allow for such completely individualized medicine. In the meantime, scientists have discovered a useful shortcut: race and ethnicity. Many genes vary across racial and ethnic lines. Geography is linked to genetic variation, and people who have the same geographic ancestry are more likely, on average, to be genetically similar than people who do not. Although there is no gene for \"race\" or \"ethnicity,\" many genes do occur in different ethnic groups at different frequencies. This means that doctors can use a patient's race or ethnicity - indicators of geographic ancestry - to make inferences about his genes, including his likelihood of developing specific diseases.(cont.) Today's Ashkenazi Jews are appealing research subjects because they are both genetically interesting and culturally willing. For the past half-century, Jewish communities have been getting the genetic scrutiny other populations can expect in the future. Such research has helped scientists make significant headway in diagnosing, treating, and preventing certain genetic diseases. But as the research studies continued, some Jewish communities began to worry about their implications.

        "Abstrak": "In-register, parallel alignment of similar or identical side chains is a common structural phenomenon in amyloid fibers. In the crystal structure of an amyloid fiber, these residues not only align, but take identical side chain orientations, creating long stacks of identical residues with identical orientations. This phenomenon of side chain stacking is a dominant component of the amyloid structure, and may take an equally important role in the seemingly sequence-independent formation of amyloid fibers or the sequence-dependent species barrier to amyloid transmission. Side chain stacking has long been observed as a prominent feature of the soluble parallel [beta]-helix fold, which exhibits a cross-[beta] structure reminiscent of amyloids. To investigate the sequence requirements of these stacks for directing a polypeptide chain into a [beta]-helical fold, we performed systematic mutational studies using the complete P22 tailspike protein, which contains a 13 rung [beta]-helix domain. The in vivo folding and assembly of 150 single mutant polypeptide chains were characterized at multiple temperatures by SDS-PAGE, which distinguishes the fully native, SDS-resistant state from partially folded or misfolded conformers. The vast majority of the buried core was completely intolerant to substitution at physiological temperatures, while only a few sites composing a continuously contacting network of residues called the folding spine were intolerant of alanine mutations at 18⁰C. These results indicate that the [beta]-helix folds through a processive folding mechanism, analogous to the nucleation and elongation mechanism of amyloids, but requiring recurring sequence-dependent stacking contacts that stretch the length of the [beta]-helix. Numerous avenues of investigation demonstrated that the observed folding defects of the full length tailspike were due to a sequence effect on the folding of the [beta]-helix domain.(cont.) Alanine mutants capable of reaching a native-like trimeric state were as thermostable as the wild-type trimer, indicating that mutants affect a folding intermediate rather than the native state. In vivo folding efficiencies of eight [beta]-helix folding mutants in the context of the isolated [beta]-helix domain paralleled the folding of the full length tailspike, demonstrating that these mutants act at the level of [beta]-helix folding. In vitro refolding of both full length and isolated [beta]-helix tailspike mutants demonstrated that the observed mutant folding deficiencies were solely caused by the single amino acid change and not due to interactions with cellular components. Folding spine mutations were further tested in the context of a suppressor mutation, A334V, which was previously shown to stabilize the [beta]-helix and rescue classic temperature sensitive folding mutations. Most mutations could not be rescued by the addition of A334V, a number of which were in fact further hindered in folding by the presence of the suppressor mutation. Eight folding spine mutations located between rungs 4 and 6 were rescued in a position specific manner, though only one of these positions directly contacts the suppressor. The pattern of rescue and hindrance observed with double mutants indicates that A334V is not a global suppressor and instead acts on a likely nucleus for folding. These studies provide evidence for a nucleation and elongation mechanism for folding of the parallel [beta]-helix. Single mutations throughout the [beta]-helix are capable of blocking this step-wise folding mechanism in a temperature dependent manner that likely leads to the population of a partially folded [beta]-helix species that would be inherently aggregation prone.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis seeks to advance our understanding of the dynamic nature, spatial organization and depositional record of topography in sand-bedded rivers. I examine patterns and processes over a wide range of scales, on Earth and Mars. At the smallest scale, ripples and dunes (bedforms) arise spontaneously under most natural flow conditions, acting as the primary agents of sediment transport and flow resistance in sandy rivers. I use physical modeling in a laboratory flume to explore the feedbacks among bedform geometry, fluid flow and sediment transport. Field observations of dunes in the North Loup River, Nebraska, show that bed roughness displays a statistical steady state and robust scaling. Motivated by these data, I develop a nonlinear stochastic surface evolution model for the topography of sandy rivers which captures the essence of bedform evolution in space and time. I then use a simplified kinematic model for bedform evolution to simulate the production of stratigraphy from migrating dunes, allowing a more accurate reconstruction of river flow conditions from preserved bedform remnants in rocks. At the channel scale I examine the conditions that lead to avulsion, the rapid abandonment of a river channel in favor of a new course at lower elevation.(cont.) Simple scaling arguments and data from 30 natural systems reveal that anastomosing (multi-branch) rivers and distributary deltas are morphologies that arise when avulsion is the dominant mechanism of channel adjustment. I apply these arguments to the Niobrara River, Nebraska, which has experienced rapid in-channel deposition due to base level rise. I show that the planform pattern of the Niobrara is dominated by base-level-driven avulsions, and is decoupled from the smaller-scale sediment transport. At the largest considered scale are depositional fans, which are constructed by avulsing rivers. The evolution of a fan profile may be modeled at long time- and space-averaged scales as a diffusive process. I use such a model to invert topographic and volumetric data from a fluvial fan on Mars, producing an estimate of the time required to build the fan out of channel and overbank deposits.",

        "Abstrak": "Advanced composite materials become popular in construction industry for the innovative building design solutions including strengthening and retrofitting of existing structures. The interface between different materials is a key issue of such design solutions as the structural integrity relies much on the bond. Knowledge on durability of concrete/epoxy interface is becoming essential as the use of these systems in applications such as FRP strengthening and retrofitting of concrete structures is becoming increasingly popular. Prior research studies in this area have indicated that moisture affected debonding in a FRP-bonded concrete system is a complex phenomenon that may often involve a distinctive dry-to-wet debonding mode shift from material decohesion (concrete delamination) to interface separation (concrete/epoxy interface) in which concrete/epoxy interface becomes the critical region of failure. Such premature failures may occur regardless of the durability of the individual constituent materials forming the material systems. Thus, the durability of FRP-bonded concrete is governed by the microstructure of the concrete/epoxy interface as affected by moisture ingress. In this work, fracture toughness of concrete/epoxy interfaces as affected by combinations of various degrees of moisture ingress and temperature levels is quantified. For this purpose, sandwich beam specimens containing concrete/epoxy interfaces are tested and analyzed using the concepts of fracture mechanics.(cont.) Experimental results have shown a significant decrease in the interfacial fracture toughness of concrete/epoxy bond with selected levels of moisture and temperature conditioning of the specimens. The strength of adhesive joint degrades as implied by the failure mode shift from concrete decohesion in controlled specimens to interface separation in conditioned specimens. In this thesis, primary data on the mixed mode fracture toughness of concrete/epoxy interfaces are presented as a basis for use in the design improvement of material systems containing such interfaces for better system durability, and issues related to the structural implications are also discussed.",

        "Abstrak": "The work presented in this thesis falls under the broad umbrella of combinatorics of Erd's type. We describe diverse facets of interplay between geometry and combinatorics and consider several questions about existence of structures in various combinatorial settings. We make contributions to specific problems in combinatorial geometry, Ramsey theory and graph theory. We first study extremal questions in geometric graph theory, that is, the existence of collections of edges with a specified crossing pattern in drawings of graphs in the plane with sufficiently many edges. Among other results, we prove that any drawing of a graph on n vertices and Cn edges, where C is a sufficiently large constant, contains each of the following crossing patterns: (1) three pairwise crossing edges, (2) two edges that cross and are crossed by k other edges, (3) an edge crossed by four other edges. In the latter, we show that C = 5.5 is the best possible constant, which, through Szekely's method, gives the best known value for a constant in the well known \"Crossing Lemma\" due to Ajtai, Chvatal, Leighton, Newborn and Szemeredi. After relaxing graph planarity in several ways, we proceed to study ... the maximum number of edges in a drawing of a graph on n vertices without self-crossing copy of C4, the cycle of four vertices. We prove that ... The importance of this and the above mentioned results comes from numerous applications of \"Crossing Lemma\" and the bounds on ... in discrete and computational geometry (incidence and Gallai-Sylvester type problems, k-set problems,(cont.) the distinct distances and the unit distance problems of Erd6s, problems on arrangements of circles and pseudo-parabolas, questions on parametric and kinetic minimum spanning trees), number theory, and the VLSI design. Next, we initiate a new trend in Ramsey theory, which can be categorized as the rainbow Ramsey theory. Drawing a parallel with Moztkin's statement that \"complete disorder is impossible\", we prove the existence of rainbow/hetero-chromatic structures in a colored universe, under certain density conditions on the coloring. Hence, we provide several striking examples supporting the new philosophy that complete disorder is unavoidable as well. In particular, we prove that every 3-coloring of the color classes being equinumerous, contains a rainbow 3-term arithmetic progression. We also consider rainbow counterparts of other classical theorems in Ramsey theory, such as Rado's and Hales-Jewett theorem. Additionally, we refute one geometric strengthening of van der Waerden's theorem, thus, answering an open problem posed by Pach. We continue with two classical problems in Euclidean Ramsey theory: (1) Hadwiger-Nelson problem on the chromatic number of Rd and (2) the empty convex hexagon question of Erd6s. We prove that the chromatic number of R3 is at most 15, improving the previous bound of 18, due to Coulson. Regarding the latter question, which is one of the most notorious open problem in combinatorial geometry, we discover interesting relations on the numbers Xk(P) of empty convex k-gons in an n-element planar point set P ...",

However, the role of IL-12 in the regulation of memory CD8+ T cell differentiation and function during murine toxoplasmosis is unclear. To track memory CTL development, we identified a novel H-2Kb-restricted CTL population specific for the Toxoplasma antigen tgd057. Tgd057-specific CTLs were induced by both vaccination and natural peroral infection, and were representative of the polyclonal CTL population. Tgd057-specific primary effector cells required IL-12 for the differentiation of KLRG1+ effector subpopulations and IFN-γ production in response to restimulation with parasite-infected cells, but not to restimulation with cognate peptide. The effect of IL-12 deficiency during the primary response was profoundly imprinted on memory CTLs, which continued to show defects in cell numbers, KLRG1+ effector memory subpopulation differentiation, and IFN-γ recall responses. Importantly, isolated CD62Lhi KLRG1- CD8+ T cells differentiated in the absence of IL-12 were enhanced in their ability to generate IFN-γ-producing secondary tgd057-specific effector cells. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate the negative impact of IL-12 signaling on the quality of the central memory CTL compartment. Thus, despite the beneficial role of IL-12 in promoting effector differentiation, excessive exposure to IL-12 during CTL priming may limit the development of long-term protective immunity through the decreased fitness of central memory CTL responses.",

Various phenomena are modelled such as fluid inertia effects, laminar orifice flow, air entrained in the hydraulic fluid, and cavitation.  Simulation results demonstrate good model accuracy when compared t.o test data for similar hydraulic dampers. Parametric studies involving various elements of the system including gas pressurization, the amount of entrained air, and stiction are conducted in order to demonstrate the affects of these parameters on system per­formance. Results indicate the fundamental characteristics of shock absorbers are produced by the interaction of resistive and capacitive elements inherent in these systems.  Capacitive elements combine with resistive elements resulting in hysteresis in the force-velocity characteristic and less energy dissipation at higher frequencies for con­stant maximum stroking velocities. The effects of fluid inertia and laminar flow are found to be negligible for the range of frequencies investigated ( 1 to 20Hz) in the monotube design of this study.

The CMG con­trol system is used specifically to provide three-axis altitude stabilization, precision pointing con­trol and maneuvering capability. Two types of CMGs are used in spacecraft attitude control purpose. Classified by the number of gimbals, they are Double Jimbal Control Moment Gyro­scope (DGCMG) and Single Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscope (SGCMG). An SGCMG is often chosen as a torque actuator because an SGCMG has two major advantages over DGCMGs: the torque amplification feature and ease of manufacture. The technical literature discusses altitude control of large spacecraft using three or more SGCMGs.  As a case study, the altitude control of rigid spacecraft using two SGCMGs is considered. In this paper, the simplified two-SGCMGs model was made and simulated. The system of interest is nonholonomic and the control strategy is related to motion planning. I demonstrate that often only two SGCMGs are necessary to control the altitude of a spacecraft. This is true when failure of one of the control momentum gyroscopes occurs, two actuators can be used to control the attitude of a rigid spacecraft and arbitrary reorientation maneuvers of the spacecraft can be accomplished.

        "Abstrak": "Public mortgage insurance (MI) is one type of supply-side government intervention in housing finance. It is an important component of the modem housing finance market, employed to expand homeownership and provide credit enhancement to mortgage loans. This research explores the feasibility and functioning of public MI, by conducting an international comparison of three representative public MI programs: the U.S. Federal Housing Administration; the Dutch Homeownership Guarantee Fund; and the Mexican Federal Mortgage Corporation. The main purpose is to build an integrated framework for policymakers when considering a public MI scheme, from institutional, financial, and operational perspectives. Research methodologies used include case studies, interviews, Monte Carlo simulation models, and regression analyses. The analytical framework of this research comprises three research questions: a) What are the primary economic problems in housing and housing finance markets that cause market inefficiency and hence call for government intervention in the form of public MI? b) What are the implied liabilities imposed on the backing government of sponsoring a public MI enterprise? and c) What are the potential economic problems that can result from the creation of a public MI system?(cont.) Answers to these questions indicate that public MI can be an effective policy tool to address particular housing market inefficiencies. However, a good fit between public MI and a nation's housing and housing finance markets entails many factors, including economic, financial, legal, political, institutional, and even cultural. Public MI should be designed and priced properly to maintain its financial soundness over the long term, without imposing \"hidden\" liabilities on the backing government. Certain institutional arrangements and operational strategies are necessary to ensure public MI's relative independence and to control market distortions stemming from its presence. This research contributes to the knowledge base for any country considering a public MI scheme to boost its housing market development. It is intended to offer much needed insight into the economic rationale, financial viability, institutional and legal infrastructure, and operational strategies of government-sponsored MI programs, and help policymakers make informed decisions based on a holistic socio-economic view of the public MI.",

        "Abstrak": "Several high-tech regions today show signs of displacement and exclusion of low-skill workers from the employment and wage benefits of a booming economy. Whether high-tech activities are responsible for these trends or if the ex ante characteristics of the region could predispose its residents to exclusion, in the absence of high-tech growth, are issues that regional scientists have left largely unexplored. Understanding what low-skill and high-skill workers undergo in the presence of this activity, and how that compares to the reality of those who reside in regions whose economy is not dependent on knowledge-intensive sectors, provides a backdrop for policy makers to evaluate industry-choice decisions in the interest of economic growth and social equity in regional development. To provide that backdrop, I empirically answer: How are the benefits of high-tech development distributed between less- and more-educated workers? How does this distribution compare to that of regions that do not follow an education-intensive development path? Are social equity and sustained growth possible under these conditions? Through regression analysis across 50 regions in the United States during the 1990s, I show that shifts in regional economic-base composition towards a greater concentration of high-tech activity cannot be held on its own responsible for exclusionary patterns in these regions.(cont.) As high-tech activity increases in a region it attracts workers of all skill levels, causing employment upsurges that are more substantial for college graduates than for high-school graduates. This shift in economic-base composition yields wage drops for low-skill workers but only when migration and cost-of-living are taken into consideration. Conversely, shifts in the composition of the region's workforce towards a more-educated labor pool resulting from migration flows lead to an employment-growth shrinkage for all skill groups, this adverse effect in supply being stronger on high-skill labor than on low-skill labor. As the proportion of college graduates increases, it deters high-skill workers from entering the region, slowing down growth in their supply, their wages, and overall growth in an economy based in this input. Once cost-of-living and migration are taken into consideration, an increase in this proportion yields wage drops for high-school graduates and a small wage gain in college graduate wages, causing greater wage inequality between more- and less-educated workers and more- and less-educated regions.",

        "Abstrak": "Even as the acceptance of the fossil fuel greenhouse effect theory continues to grow amongst academics, statesmen and plebeians alike, the early adopters have already engaged in pre-emptive research activities aimed at mitigating the effects of such greenhouse gases. The focus of one such effort is on the capture and storage of CO₂ (carbon dioxide) from anthropogenic fixed source emissions. This effort can be broken down into a few broad categories such as terrestrial, ocean and geologic sequestration. Geologic sequestration refers to all activities geared towards the capture and storage of CO₂ under the surface of the earth in diverse 'reservoirs' such as deep saline formations, depleted oil and gas wells and unmineable coal seams to name a few. This investigation develops a systems perspective for assessing carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) opportunities within the realm of geologic sequestration. While multiple concurrent research activities continue to explore CCS opportunities from various perspectives, efforts at a systems analysis of the overall picture are just beginning. A systems view describing methodologies to integrate a variety of CCS data to assess potential sequestration opportunities is at the heart of this study. It is based on research being conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under sponsorship of the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and publicly available data, a detailed characterization of CO₂ sources and reservoirs are being developed. A source-reservoir matching process will be implemented which begins with quantifying the 'capturability' of a CO₂ source, a function of the purity, volume and several site specific considerations. Next, the potential(cont.) proximate reservoirs are identified and then ranked based on transport options, type, capacity, cost, regulatory considerations and political sensitivity. All the above criteria will be spatially represented in the GIS and can be overlaid to produce a composite picture identifying the potential areas which would represent the maximum probability of success in sequestration efforts. A rigorous systems engineering approach will be adopted throughout the investigation. Novel tools such as the Object-Process CASE (OPCAT) tool will be used to model the complex and interdisciplinary system. A comprehensive systems modeling and engineering tool, it allows the representation of function, structure and behavior in a single model. Ultimately, the methodologies developed will be integrated and utilized in a case study to illustrate the methodology of evaluating CCS options for a given set of sources. A region in Mississippi has been identified for this model case-study. The methodology will be applied at a later time to evaluate CCS potential in the South East Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SERCSP) and the West Coast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (WCRCSP).",

Its technology and service are now in third generation: 3G, and already moving forward to 4G. Within a few years, it will enable the exchange of multimedia contents with huge digital data over the air. In the global market, most countries have deregulation and encourage now free competition. Especially emerging market e.g. BRICS is rapidly growing and intensifying the global competition. Furthermore, it seems that the internet revolution forces the industry to change their traditional business model entirely. In this situation, wireless telecom carriers may not be able to survive if they fail to adapt to the new evolved environment. They need developing an appropriate global business strategy, taking into account all complex essential factors: integration with the internet, sustainable disruptive innovation, international technology standardization and market globalization. What framework and method can solve the problem?(cont.) This is the essential question for the industry. In order to answer the question, I believe that any player in the industry has to investigate these dynamics and interrelation each factor has, and design business strategy to achieve sustainable growth in the complex market. In the thesis, as one part of the solution, I propose (i) a hybrid analysis method how to investigate the industry and capture the complex dynamics, and (ii) strategy development procedure to support appropriate business strategy for future wireless communication business. In terms of (i), I introduce three analysis tools: my Triangle Pyramid Configuration Study (TPCS), Porter's Competitive Advantage Analysis and Lessard's RATs Test. Regarding to (ii), I clarify a scheme to integrate these analyses results obtained by (i) for the business strategy development.

        "Abstrak": "The healthcare industry is expanding swiftly and total healthcare expenditures are expected to reach 18% of GDP by 2008. However there exist steep variances in quality of care and high incidences of medical error. This has given impetus to efforts at progressively evolving the healthcare delivery system. The role of information technology (IT) is seen as being central to cost reduction and quality improvement of healthcare delivery. Furthermore, efficiency gains will realize approximately 20% in cost reductions. However, there are significant challenges associated with widespread adoption of IT by healthcare providers. Despite the existence of vendor and technology maturity, implementation rates for clinical patient record systems were only 35% in 2006. This study addresses the problem of low IT adoption in hospitals through a three pronged analysis methodology. A Clockspeed analysis has revealed a dichotomy between the maturity levels of technology and vendors on the one hand and delivery processes on the other. This has resulted in lower business value being realized from IT investments by healthcare providers.(cont.) To address the concern of low business value realization from IT investments, a workflow and Social Networking Analysis was conducted on the surgery patient flow process of a prominent Boston area hospital. It was demonstrated that productivity gains could be achieved through redesign of social networks at the workplace and by inculcating an enterprise-wide process orientation. This would generate greater business value from existing IT investments and thereby impact the rate of IT adoption. Furthermore, an assessment of IT Governance styles and IT Architecture maturity was done at the same Boston area hospital. The findings revealed the requirements necessary for migration towards an IT Architecture that could deliver data integration and an enterprise-wide process orientation. A top management driven approach towards a uniformity in governance styles and an alignment of business strategies throughout the organization were identified as the key requirements. The improved business value realized from IT investments through this combined approach makes the case for faster IT adoption by hospitals, and by extension, by healthcare providers in general.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is concerned with the commercial applications of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) manufacturing processes to advanced energy technologies. This field of engineering has come to be known as Power MEMS. Four such technologies are singled-out for detailed consideration, based on the efforts that have gone into demonstrating the benefits which MEMS has to offer them. The first are micro engines or turbines which generate of order 10-100 Watts of power by driving an electric generator, as exemplified by the famous MIT microturbine. The second are micro fuel cells, electrochemical devices which air oxidize chemical fuels, particularly the direct methanol fuel cell which operates at modest temperatures and hence is suitable for use in portable electronics. The third are solid-state devices which convert heat into electricity via either the Seeback (thermocouple) or photovoltaic effects, or else via thermionic emission. Finally, we consider devices which scavenge vibrational or electromagnetic energy from their environment, and are an attractive means of powering remote autonomous sensors or medical implants such as pacemakers.(cont.) Following a survey of recent commercial activity in these technologies, we consider the markets they may serve, the economics of their MEMS-based production, and possible business models for their commercialization. Detailed case studies are presented of two recent startups, one of which is developing a heat-to-electricity conversion system based on the photovoltaic effect, and the other of which is studying a novel MEMS device which would use springs made out of carbon nanotubes to store energy. The conclusion is that the time is ripe for a power MEMS technology roadmap which can inspire energy technology companies to work together towards an industrial ecosystem like that now seen in the semiconductor industry. Specifically, we propose that by using MEMS as a unifying technology, it will become possible to easily buy, sell and trade knowledge, personnel, components and foundry services, facilitating experimentation with new products and business models and greatly accelerating the development of power MEMS itself. This may in turn lead to solutions to some of the pressing energy and environmental problems which society now faces.",

The problem we face with space pollution is complex and serious. The space treaties and conventions are not sufficient. They were drafted at the time of space exploration in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, they fail to account for rapid changes in the field, especially the increasing commercial activity. Moreover, the existing mitigation guidelines remain voluntary and are not legally binding under international law. As a result, space debris tends to accumulate and remains in orbit for a long period of time. A space debris convention is thus warranted. The proposed international convention would have the following objectives: 1) Implement an international and independent tracking and cataloguing system for space debris; 2) Adopt enforceable space debris mitigation and disposal guidelines; 3) Enforce a space preservation provision for protecting the most vulnerable outer space regions and; 4) Define a space debris compensation and dispute settlement mechanism.(cont.) The convention must bring all together policy-makers and the civil society for addressing this problem; it is also time for the space industry to play its corporate social responsibility and to actively seek to participate to the drafting and implementing of the convention. More than ever, the space debris problem is hindering space commerce, space tourism, the scientific exploration of space, the use of raw materials from space, and even distant plans for the future settlement of space. The possibility of great harm posed by debris should bring all nations and stakeholders together to find the most appropriate solutions.",

        "Abstrak": "Hydrogen is considered a good energy carrier candidate for future automotive applications because of its high abundance and its potential role in a carbon-free cycle. The high gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities of metal hydrides make them ideal hydrogen carriers if the limitations associated with their slow hydrogen release kinetics, their high hydrogen release temperatures, and their poor thermal properties can be resolved. In this thesis, the thermodynamic and kinetic improvements on the hydrogen release properties of nanostructured metal hydrides are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Four main results are presented in this work. The excess volume present in deformed regions is identified as the key factor in explaining the reduction in the enthalpy of formation observed experimentally in nanostructured materials. The impact of excess volume on the enthalpy of formation at OK is quantified using three equations of state, and it is found to be as important as the combined impact of surfaces, grain boundaries and the presence of metastable crystalline phases. Then, the findings on the properties of excess volume are generalized to high temperatures. It is demonstrated that the impact of temperature will be more favorable to a reduction of the enthalpy of formation if a large fraction of the metal hydride is in a state of small excess volume compared to a small fraction of the hydride in a state of high excess volume. The impact of a temperature increase on the enthalpy of formation of metal hydrides is found to offset the effect of the excess volume as calculated at OK.(cont.) The stability of the regions containing excess volume over multiple hydriding/dehydriding cycles is also calculated. At high temperatures and large excess volumes, the free energy barrier created by the excess entropy reduces the recrystallization rate of the deformed regions by several orders of magnitude. A regime where the benefits of the excess volume on the enthalpy of formation can be maintained is thus identified. Finally, an experiment to study the cycling properties of metal hydrides was designed using Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the release temperature of hydrogen could be accurately measured using Raman spectroscopy.",

We present two sets of experiments, one focusing on properties in the integer quantum Hall effect the second looking at properties in the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling fraction v = 5/2. Both sets of experiments employ electrostatically defined quantum point contacts (QPCs) fabricated on a high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). In the first set of experiments, we study the suppression of the spin splitting of the Landau levels in QPCs compared to the bulk 2DEG. By using QPCs with different lithographic widths and varying the voltage applied on the gates, we can control the width of the conduction channel from ~3000 to ~100 nm. The width of the channel is estimated from the low magnetic field dependence of the conductance through the QPC. We study the suppression of the spin-splitting of the Landau levels as a function of the effective width of the QPC and measure the number of channels of conduction Ns, above which the spin-splitting is no longer observed. We find that Ns is approximately half of the number of quantized channels in the QPC for all widths less than approximately 1200 nm. For the same width range, we show that the cyclotron diameter at the lowest magnetic field where the spin splitting is resolved is half of the effective width of the QPC. In the second set of experiments, in the fractional quantum Hall regime at v = 5/2, QPCs are used to bring counter-propagating edge states close enough that quasiparticles can tunnel between them.₂(cont.) Weak quasiparticle tunneling has been long proposed as a method to study the properties of these quasiparticles, because the tunneling conductance depends on both the charge of the tunneling quasiparticles and the modified Coulomb interaction that characterizes their interactions. Several models have been proposed to describe the state at v = 5/2; some predict non-abelian statistics, while others predict the more mundane abelian properties. Although all models predict the same quasiparticle charge e* = 1/4, they predict different values of the interaction parameter, thus allowing us to potentially discriminate between them. We study the temperature and dc bias dependence of the tunneling conductance, while preserving the same filling fraction in the constriction and the bulk of the sample. The data show scaling of the bias-dependent tunneling over a range of temperatures, in agreement with the theory of weak quasiparticle tunneling, allowing us to extract values for the effective charge and interaction parameter of the quasiparticles. The ranges of values obtained are consistent with those predicted by the anti-Pfaffian and the U(1) x SU₂(2) models, making these non-abelian states more likely than abelian ones.",

The time-dependent angular analysis is used to extract the decay widths of the heavy and light B, eigenstates and the difference between these decay widths AF, - FL - FH. Initial-state flavor tagging is used to determine the matter-antimatter content of the B. mesons at production time.

        "Abstrak": "Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in plasma physics, which involves the often explosive release of magnetically stored energy in both space and laboratory plasmas. In order for this sudden release of energy to occur, there must be a period of slow reconnection, in which magnetic stress accumulates in the system, followed by a quick transition to fast reconnection. The question of what causes this transition is known as the 'trigger problem' and is not well understood. We address the trigger problem using the Versatile Toroidal Facility (VTF) at MIT, which we operate in the strong magnetic guide field regime. The resulting reconnection occurs in spontaneous events, in which there is a transition to fast reconnection. The reconnection in these events is asymmetric: it begins at one toroidal location and propagates toroidally in both directions. The spontaneous onset is facilitated by an interaction between the x-line current channel and a global mode, which breaks axisymmetry. We model the onset using an empirical Ohm's law and current continuity, which is maintained by ion polarization currents associated with the mode. The model reproduces the exponential growth of the reconnection electric field, and the model growth rate agrees well with the experimentally measured growth rate. We begin, however, by discussing reconnection in the collisional regime and the effect of neutral gas on plasma flows. We perform experiments which are relevant to plasmas at the edge of tokamaks, but may also be applicable to reconnection in the solar photosphere and the interstellar medium, where the ionization fraction is low. In these experiments, a plasma filament propagates across a magnetic field in a background of neutral atoms. The filament motion is driven by charge separation in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, and this drive is balanced by collisional damping. The filament propagation and internal structure are described in detail.",

        "Abstrak": "Over the past decade, many computational studies have explored the mechanics of instrumented normal indentation. In contrast, very few studies have investigated quantitative aspects of frictional sliding contact in the elasto-plastic regime. In this thesis, a new framework was developed to establish relationships between the frictional sliding response, material properties and contact parameters. Dimensional analysis enabled to define scaling variables and dimensionless functions. Finite element methods were used to simulate the process of steady-state frictional sliding and evaluate the dimensionless functions. In frictional sliding, the representative plastic strain was found to be more than four times as large as in normal indentation. Further comparison with indentation indicated a three fold increase in the maximum pile-up height and an increased influence of the strain hardening on hardness. Experimental studies were conducted with and without a liquid lubricant in selected material systems. Quantitative agreements with numerical predictions were observed in all cases. The strong influence of the strain hardening exponent on the pile-up height was illustrated from frictional sliding results obtained in copper and copper-zinc specimens of different grain sizes.(cont.) Also, the influence of hardening characteristics was illustrated by preparing two microstructures of an aluminum alloy to have the same indentation hardness. These materials with same indentation hardness showed significantly different hardness and pile-up in frictional sliding. Experiments were also carried out on nanocrystalline nickel and alloys of different grain sizes. The addition of tungsten did not change significantly the strain hardening behavior of nanocrystalline nickel but it did stabilize significantly the microstructure in repeated pass experiments. A reverse algorithm was developed to extract plastic flow properties from the frictional sliding response. This algorithm uses the scratch hardness and pile-up measurements to estimate yield strength and strain hardening exponent. Based on sensitivity analysis, the accuracy on these estimates is significantly improved as compared to reverse algorithms for instrumented indentation, especially for the strain hardening exponent. Frictional sliding is an alternative or complement to instrumented indentation. It can provide a different ranking of materials for their tribological resistance. It can also be used to estimate plastic flow properties.",

        "Abstrak": "Block copolymers have proven to be a unique materials platform for easily fabricated large-area photonic crystals. While the basic concept of block copolymer based photonic band gap materials has been well demonstrated, little work has been achieved yet in terms of realizing optically active devices using these materials. [n this thesis, the utilization of block copolymer photonic crystals for creating self-assembled active optical elements has been experimentally explored with a special emphasis on optically driven lasing and stimulus responsive tunable reflectors. In pursuing these primary objectives, control of thin film microdomain orientation and novel three-dimensional (3D) optical characterization of block copolymer photonic crystals have been also achieved, both of which can greatly help optimize the properties of block copolymer photonic crystals. First, a laser cavity using block copolymer based one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystals has been demonstrated. Optically pumped surface-emitting lasing has been obtained using a dye-doped polymers as the organic gain medium and the self-assembled block copolymer as the spectral-band selective distributed Bragg reflector feedback element.(cont.) We also developed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid photonic crystal containing a dye-doped defect layer for defect-mode photonic bandgap lasing. Low threshold lasing has been demonstrated at a single defect-mode wavelength of the D photonic bandgap structure resulting from the inhibited density of states of photons within the stop band and the enhanced rates of spontaneous emission at the localized resonant defect mode. Second, stimulus responsive tunable self-assembled reflectors based on D block copolymer photonic crystals have been studied. Three external stimuli such as solvent, temperature, and compressive mechanical strain have been employed to modulate microstructural and material properties of block copolymer photonic crystals, resulting in effective tuning of the spectral characteristics of block copolymer photonic structures. Finally, control of the microdomain orientation of ID and 2D block copolymer photonic crystals has been achieved over a large area via directional solidification of solvent. Moreover, an intriguing ordering behavior of these ultrahigh molecular weight block copolymers has been revealed, which is dramatically different from that of typical molecular weight block copolymers. These highly oriented thin film microdomain patterns have been explored via 3D optical imaging using laser scanning confocal microscopy.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is dedicated to development and application of a novel large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanoscale materials. Electron transport at the nanometer scale involves phenomena which are beyond the realm of classical transport theory: the wave character of the electrons becomes central, and the Schrddinger equation needs to be solved explicitly. First-principles calculations can nowadays deal with systems containing hundreds of electrons, but simulations for nanostructures that contain thousands of atoms or more need to rely on parametrized Hamiltonians. The core of our approach lies in the derivation of exact and chemically-specific Hamiltonians from first-principles calculations, in a basis of maximally-localized Wannier functions, that become explicit tight-binding orbitals. Once this optimal basis is determined, the Hamiltonian matrix becomes short-ranged, diagonally-dominant, and transferable - i.e. a large nanostructure can be constructed by assembling together the Hamiltonians of its constitutive building block. This approach is first demonstrated for pristine semiconducting and metallic nanotubes, demonstrating perfect agreement with full first-principles calculations in a complete planewave basis.(cont.) Then, it is applied to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of functionalized carbon nanotubes. The first class of functionalizing addends, represented by single-bond covalent ligands (e.g. hydrogens or aryls), turns out to affect very strongly the back-scattering and the conductance, since sp3 rehybridization at the sidewall carbon where a group is attached dramatically perturbs the conjugated [pi]-bonding network. Inspection on the shape and the on-site energy of MLWFs before and after functionalizations leads to the conclusion that the effect of sp3 rehybridization is essentially identical to removing a \"half-filled\" p-orbital from the [pi]-manifold. In this perspective, the chemical difference between functional groups (e.g. different electronegativity of the residues) is relatively minor, even if, of course, will lead to different doping of the tube. We also find that these single-bond ligands tend to cluster, and are more stable when two groups are located nearby (incidentally, the degree of perturbation at the Fermi level becomes weaker when such paired configuration is assumed). The second class of functionalizing addends, represented by cycloaddition functionalizations (e.g. carbenes and nitrenes), demonstrates a radically different behavior.(cont.) These addends are bonded to two neighboring sidewall carbon atoms, creating a three-membered ring structure. On narrow-diameter tubes, cleaving of the sidewall bond takes place to release the high strain energy of a three-membered ring. In the process, the two sidewall carbons recover their original sp2 hybridization. This step is crucial, since the quantum conductance of a metallic nanotube then recovers almost perfectly the ideal limit of a pristine tube: the bond cleavage restores a transparent conduction manifold. Bond cleavage is controlled by the chemistry of the functional groups and the curvature of the nanotubes. High-curvature favors bond opening, whereas in graphene the bond is always closed; in between the two limits, chemistry determines the critical curvature at which the open-to-closed transition takes place. The preference for bond opening or closing has been screened extensively for different classes of functional groups, using initially some molecular homologues of the nanotubes. It is found that a subclass of addends, exemplified by dicyanocarbene, can assume both the open and closed form in the same tube around a narrow range of diameters.(cont.) While these two forms are very similar in energy, and separated by a small barrier (hence they can be considered \"fluxional\" tautomers), the quantum conductance in the closed case is found to be significantly lower than that in the open case. Interconversion between the two minima could then be directed by optical or electrochemical means, in turn controlling the conductance of the functionalized tubes. We envision thus that this novel class of functionalization will offer a practical way toward non-destructive chemistry that can either preserve the metallic conductance of the tubes, or modulate it in real-time, with foreseeable applications in memories, sensors, imaging, and optoelectronic devices.",

        "Abstrak": "Model bicrystals made by adhering pieces of near-single-crystal styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) cylindrical block copolymer (BCP), produced by a roll-casting process; yield various types of pure tilt grain boundaries. The study of the deformation of the bicrystals, each containing one grain boundary, enables a deeper understanding of the influences grain boundaries and the incompatibilities between them have on mechanical behavior. Mechanical properties and deformation of near-single-crystal systems provide a reference base for the expected bicrystal behavior. We consider various aspects of incompatibility that can arise from joining two highly anisotropic grains together (i.e. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, deformation mode(s)). Experimentally, the structure of grain boundaries was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In deformation experiments, optical microscopy was employed to examine the deformation gradient in the specimen and in situ small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to monitor the microdomain structural evolution. Finally, finite element simulations illustrated the state of strains of the bicrystal. The symmetric (45-45) bicrystal turns out to be the most complex system, despite of the simplest geometry.(cont.) Due to the opposite orientation of the grains, the deformation of the symmetric bicrystal results in a rigid translation of the grain boundary. A triangular shaped influence region indicates that the influence distance varies along the grain boundary length. A portion of the influence region has limited expansion and is slightly sheared along the grain boundary. Another portion of the influence region experiences high tension. For the asymmetric (90-45) bicrystal, the deformation is mostly influenced by the difference in deformation modes: dilation vs. shearing. The distortion due to deformation in the diagonal grain induces rotation and advances the deformation in the perpendicular grain near the grain boundary. For the asymmetric (90-0) bicrystal, the most influential factors are the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio. The much softer perpendicular grain assumes most of the deformation by extensive dilation and lateral contraction. Near the grain boundary, the perpendicular grain is constrained by the rigid parallel grain such that its deformation is impeded. The influence region in the perpendicular grain is narrow and invariant along the grain boundary length.",

        "Abstrak": "We present the results of theoretical calculations for the dynamical evolution of dense globular star clusters. Our new study was motivated in part by the wealth of new data made available from the latest optical, radio, and X-ray observations of globular clusters by various satellites and ground-based observatories, and in part by recent advances in computer hardware. New parallel supercomputers, combined with improved computational methods, now allow us to perform dynamical simulations of globular cluster evolution using a realistic number of stars (N - 10 - 106) and taking into account the full range of relevant stellar dynamical and stellar evolutionary processes. These processes include two-body gravitational scattering, strong interactions and physical collisions involving both single and binary stars, stellar evolution of single stars, and stellar evolution and interactions in close binary stars. We have developed a new numerical code for computing the dynamical evolution of a dense star cluster. Our code is based on a Monte Carlo technique for integrating numerically the Fokker-Planck equation. We have used this new code to study a number of important problems. In particular, we have studied the evolution of globular clusters in our Galaxy, including the effects of a mass spectrum, mass loss due to the tidal field of the Galaxy, and stellar evolution. Our results show that the direct mass loss from stellar evolution can significantly accelerate the total mass loss from a globular cluster, causing most clusters with low initial central concentrations to disrupt completely. Only clusters born with high central concentrations, or with relatively few massive stars, are likely to survive until the present and remain observable. Our study of mass segregation in clusters shows that it is possible to retain significant numbers of very-low-mass (m < 0.1M.) objects, such as brown dwarfs or planets, in the outer halos of globular clusters, even though they are quickly lost from the central, denser regions. This is contrary to the common belief that globular clusters are devoid of such low-mass objects. We have also performed, for the first time, dynamical simulations of clusters containing a realistic number of stars and a significant fraction of binaries. We find that the energy generated through binarybinary and binary-single-star interactions in the cluster core can support the system against gravothermal collapse on timescales exceeding the age of the Universe, explaining naturally the properties of the majority of observed globular clusters with resolved cores.",

        "Abstrak": "We have identified the genes responsible for SERCA2a-induced reversal of heart failure, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and developed countries. We have previously shown that restoration of a key enzyme that controls intracellular Ca2+ handling, the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a), induces reversal of heart failure in humans and experimental models. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to explore the genetic reprogramming responsible for the reversal of heart failure upon adenoviral gene transfer of SERCA2a in a rat model of pressure overload hypertrophy in transition to heart failure. We combined model- and data-driven approaches to analyze the resulting multivariate microarray expression dataset corresponding to 4237 transcript sequences in six experimental groups. A multiscale systems approach was used that incorporated the main mechanisms underlying the control of gene expression at the transcriptional level, and the pathologic compensatory responses that occur in heart failure. The combinatorial control of gene expression that is thought to occur in mammals was implemented in a signal-processing model at the level of the heart cell nucleus; it identified 473 SERCA2a regulated genes. The integration of the main mechanisms underlying the pathologic compensatory responses that take place in heart failure was fundamental to the discovery of 10 functional transcriptional classes within this group of genes. In addition, 226 genes that were not targets of SERCA2a but were natural adaptive responses to aortic banding needed for clinical non-failure, were identified and functionally categorized. Biological functional distribution of SERCA2a targets revealed that SERCA2a activates genes(cont.) that function mainly in the cytoskeleton, ECM, Ca2+ signaling, signal transduction, cell cycle and growth and development pathways. The integration of model- and data-driven ideas was crucial to the elucidation of specific patterns in the multivariate data and allowed the discovery of novel genes and their potential role in the normalization of multiple pathways within the failing cell. This is a novel, powerful and portable method to elucidate multivariate genome-wide transcriptional networks from primary microarray data.",

        "Abstrak": "A novel DNA sequencing method is proposed based on the specific binding nature of nucleotides and measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM). A single molecule of DNA is denatured and immobilized on an atomically fiat surface, and a force probe functionalized with a nucleotide is scanned along the molecule to detect locations of the probe nucleotide's complement. To increase the spatial resolution of the atomic force microscope so that individual bases can be distinguished, a single-walled carbon nanotube is grown from the AFM probe and functionalized with a single nucleotide. The carbon nanotube diameter is of the order as the nucleotide base spacing--providing the necessary spatial resolution for single molecule sequencing. The absolute force detection limit of the microscope is thermal noise-limited and derived herein from the equipartition theorem. The calculated minimum detectable force is less than experimentally obtained nucleotide binding forces, indicating that the AFM is capable of directly measuring single nucleotide interactions. A model of the oscillating AFM probe dynamics is developed, allowing a methodical approach to determining attractive forces with a chemically-specific sensor. This attractive force detection is performed by measuring the phase lag of the oscillating probe near the sample surface as compared to the resonating probe in free air. As grown, the carbon nanotubes are too long to be used as reliable force probes, therefore a method for shortening carbon nanotubes is presented utilizing high voltages to remove material. Measuring the length of the nanotube is performed with a novel technique that exploits the nanotube's unique elastic buckling property.(cont.) This measurement technique characterizes the length of the nanotube while the probe is still mounted on the AFM and alleviates the need for a secondary microscope. The shortening procedure developed is performed in conjunction with the nucleotide functionalization, creating a precise and chemically-specific force probe. Experiments are performed on synthetic DNA of a known sequence to validate the proposed approach. A functionalized carbon nanotube force probe is scanned along single molecules of synthetic DNA to determine locations of target bases.",

In order to demonstrate these arguments, I examine selected groups of ACK titles closely in the first two chapters. I perform a detailed content analysis of these comics, considering the ways in which they draw upon history and primary texts, the artistic and editorial choices as well the implications of these decisions. In the third chapter, I draw a picture of the consumption of these comics, studying the varying interpretations and reactions that fans across generations have had to the works, connecting their conversations to my argument about ACK as public culture. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate the extent of ACK's role in the popular imagination of its large readership as well as the part it plays in the negotiation of their identities as Indians.",

It is well known that multilevel topography resulting from pattern dependencies in various processes, especially copper Electrochemical Deposition (ECD) and Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP), is a major problem in interconnects. An integrated pattern dependent chip-scale model for multilevel copper metallization is contributed to help understand and meet dishing and erosion requirements, to optimize the combined plating and polishing process to achieve minimal environmental impact, higher yield and performance, and to enable optimization of layout and dummy fill designs. First, a physics-based chip-scale copper ECD model is developed. By considering copper ion depletion effects, and surface additive adsorption and desorption, the plating model is able to predict the initial topography for subsequent CMP modeling with sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a compatible chip-scale CMP modeling is developed.(cont.) The CMP model integrates contact wear and density-step-height approaches, so that a consistent and coherent chip-scale model framework can be used for copper bulk polishing, copper over-polishing, and barrier layer polishing stages. A variant of this CMP model is developed which explicitly considers the pad topography properties. Finally, ECD and CMP parts are combined into an integrated model applicable to single level and multilevel metallization cases. The integrated multilevel copper metallization model is applied to the co-optimization of the plating and CMP processes. An alternative in-pattern (rather than between-pattern) dummy fill strategy is proposed. The integrated ECD/CMP model is applied to the optimization of the in-pattern fill, to achieve improved ECD uniformity and final post-CMP topography.",

        "Abstrak": "In order to better understand the effects on hydrocarbon emissions of loading, engine temperature, fuel type, and injection timing, a series of experiments was performed. The effect of loading was observed by running the engine at a higher temperature and more open throttle than would typically be observed at fast idle or low load driving. The effects of coolant temperature, the charge motion control valve, spark timing and rail pressure were tested through holding all other variables constant and sweeping through different injection timing to observe the effect on emissions and power output. A new fuel system was designed to allow for the quick testing of different ethanol blends. The system allowed for comparison testing of an 85% ethanol blend to UTG 91 as a function of coolant temperature and injection timing. Measurement of cylinder pressure and hydrocarbon emissions near the exhaust valve allowed for a better understanding of engine operation and the effect of using high ethanol content fuels. Initial testing was also done on 15% and 40% ethanol blends. The results revealed that engine emissions decrease as a function of reduced loading and higher engine temperatures. Sweeps of injection timings for all fuels demonstrated high hydrocarbon emissions for earlier injection timings which fell as injection timing was retarded. A secondary peak was observed in hydrocarbon emissions for an injection timing of approximately 150 CAD aTDC intake. Analysis of rate of fuel injection vs. indicated power revealed a steady decrease in indicated efficiency as injection timing was retarded up to 120 CAD aTDC Intake and then a slow rise in efficiency as the timing was further retarded. The exact causes of the decrease in engine efficiency are unknown; however, possible explanations involve increased heat transfer from the cylinder and piston, fuel loss, and inefficient combustion due to impingement on cold surfaces.",

        "Abstrak": "A compact printable microfluidic valve composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The design of the valve consists of filling microwells with poly(NIPAAm) and bonding PDMS channels above them. This filling is achieved using thermal inkjet printing of a prepolymer solution and subsequent polymerization using UV irradiation. When the gel is swollen, it blocks flow from passing through the channel. Upon heating, the gel shrinks and allows flow in the channel. Poly(NIPAAm) is a thermosensitive hydrogel that exhibits an inverse temperature expansion behavior. When the temperature of the swollen gel is raised above a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of approximately 32°C, the gel becomes hydrophobic. This change in hydrophobicity results in expulsion of the water molecules from within the hydrogel network, thus resulting in shrinking of the gel. By adding magnetic nanoparticles to the hydrogel and exposing it to an external magnetic field, volumetric change of the hydrogel can be locally and externally induced. External heating of the magnetic nanoparticles, however, is not included in this thesis. In order to ensure shrinkage that is predictable in favor of flow control, microanchor structures have been designed, modeled, and fabricated at the bottom of the microwells. These microanchors hold the poly(NIPAAm) at the bottom of the plug such that the shrinkage of the gel always acts to open the flow channel at the top yielding a minimum pressure drop. Design decisions were made using the principles of Axiomatic Design in order to minimize the response time and pressure drops in the valve. Modeling of the underlying mechanisms is described along with the application of these models to the final device. Results of fabrication suggest the feasibility while also eliciting possible improvements to the fabrication process.(cont.) Profilometry measurements of the swollen and shrunken valves reveal flow control operation as intended. Additionally, design and modeling of magnetic heating using mixed-in nanoparticles is presented. A fabrication plan designed to include this mechanism is proposed.",

In this study, we examine if this theory holds in the period preceding an earnings announcement, by testing whether there is a relationship between stock returns before and after an earnings announcement. We find that there exists a negative correlation between pre-earnings returns and post-earnings returns for small capitalization stocks that could be explained by investor irrationality. This relationship is statistically significant for pre-earnings returns calculated up to a 10 day period preceding an earnings announcement and strongest over a 3 day period. We also tested to see if there was a correlation between the earnings results in the last quarter and the movements in stock price prior to this quarter's earnings announcement, and did not observe any statistically significant outcomes.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis studies the macroeconomics of incomplete markets. Chapter 1 studies the effects of capital taxation in a dynamic heterogeneous-agent economy with uninsurable entrepreneurial risk. Unlike either the complete-markets paradigm or Bewley-type models where idiosyncratic risk impacts only labor income, here it is shown that capital taxation may actually stimulate capital accumulation. This possibility emerges because of the general-equilibrium effects of the insurance aspect of capital taxation. Chapter 2, which is joint work with George-Marios Angeletos, revisits the macroeconomic effects of government consumption in the neoclassical growth model augmented with idiosyncratic investment (or entrepreneurial) risk. Under complete markets, a permanent increase in government consumption has no long-run effect on the interest rate, the capital-labor ratio, and labor productivity, while it increases work hours due to the familiar negative wealth effect. Under incomplete markets, the very same negative wealth effect now causes a reduction in risk taking and investment. This in turn leads to a lower risk-free rate and, under certain conditions, also to a lower capital-labor ratio, lower productivity and lower wages. Chapter 3 uses annual Greek data to test the validity of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) versus the \"Keynesian\" view that consumption responds to current income. The PIH is rejected by all tests, and so is the simple excess sensitivity hypothesis with a constant marginal propensity to consume.(cont.) Subsequently, the relevance of a more sophisticated excess sensitivity version, with a time-varying marginal propensity to consume, is determined. It is shown that liquidity constraints, in the form of the spread between private interest rates on loans and deposits, negatively affect the marginal propensity to consume out of current disposable labor income. This result disappears when total disposable income is considered.",

The work presented here shows analysis of the statistical properties of the data recorded in the 2014 Nordic Seas Experiment.

        "Abstrak": "We live in a global era; we can find the same products and services around the world. The barriers that used to exist have blurred or disappeared. In the past when we traveled from one country to another, there were many differences-cultural, political, social-and many times travelers had one or two bad experiences. Today things are easier, and countries are adapting to the global market and opening their doors to the world. Technology and Communications are two key factors in this globalization process. However, the people who develop and implement these factors are the ones who are helping the world to become a global marketplace. These people are the global leaders and managers--people who think beyond their cultural and social environments, people who are able to combine the needs of different countries into a single more homogenous need, people who lead organizations and countries as they improve their strategies and join the global era. This thesis highlights the different phases of globalization through which the world has lived over the years, from the trading era where people exchanged valuable goods with each other to the global era where the marketplace is a single global market. The thesis discusses the changes in industry and the various forces driving industry to make these changes, as well as tools to help evaluate the pressures for globalization. I consider globalization from three perspectives: the broad worldview, industry level, and then company or firm level and the different ways of doing business. Moving from the macro level to the micro level, I discuss the people who work in the organizations, those who are responsible for leading and managing the firm during its drive to become a global company. I present and discuss some of the skills needed and the tools that managers can use to facilitate their strategies. Then follows a discussion of some of the generic strategies that companies can pursue and the key success factors needed to develop appropriate global strategies. Next I develop a case study of Vitrocrisa, a Mexican company searching for an approach to globalization that will work best for the company. Here I explain the strategies, structure, and challenges that Vitrocrisa is facing. Also I suggest actions and plans that the company could pursue to facilitate the process. Finally, I present general conclusions about how a company can identify the skills of global managers, and then identify potential candidates, hire, and develop them.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation is composed of three essays. I look at the role of two different but critical factors in shaping entrepreneurial outcomes: individual level career history and the institutional context. My work spans two outcomes in particular: individual decisions to choose high-tech entrepreneurial activities and the strategies and outcomes of the entrepreneurial firms that are established. Following an introductory chapter that overviews the entire dissertation, Chapter Two discusses the use of alumni surveys as a methodology. The first of my three empirical essays is Chapter Three, entitled \"Cutting Your Teeth: Building on the Micro-Foundations for Dynamic Capabilities with Edward Roberts, and investigates whether prior founding experience improves subsequent start-up firm performance. We draw on two strands of psychological theory - availability and partition dependence - and tie them together with the idea that variation in managers' cognitive representations of the competitive landscape drives differences in firm outcomes. The results of the study are consistent with an account where improved cognitive representations form dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage but appear less consistent with passive inheritance of search routines as a source of dynamic capabilities. We examine performance produced by variation in career experience driving differences in psychological biases. The second essay, \"Who has 'The Right Stuff'? Human Capital, Entrepreneurship and Institutional Change in China\", examines a model distinguishing barriers to entry from barriers to growth.(cont.) It exploits a natural experiment to identify effects on individuals at different locations on a talent distribution. The paper asks whether the 1999 Chinese Constitutional amendment increased entrepreneurship among those individuals with higher (or lower) levels of human capital. The type of institutional environment that results in higher quality entrepreneurs is a question that has not been systematically explored previously. I find that the greatest increase in entrepreneurship in the post-2000 institutional development was among individuals at the top of the talent distribution. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship among high quality individuals is driven less by the relaxation of constraints to entry (which are relatively easy to overcome) and more by constraints to firm growth. The final essay chapter is a cross-country comparison of the MIT and Tsinghua datasets. There are some relatively subtle differences that in combination with the differences in the environment for entrepreneurial firms and the institutional history of China have led to vastly different outcomes for the entrepreneurial firms from MIT and Tsinghua. The shorter time frame in which entrepreneurial activity has been occurring in China resulted in a younger, smaller set of entrepreneurial firms throughout the country. Similarly, the younger age of Tsinghua entrepreneurs contributes to a different mix of idea and team sources (fewer from work experience) that might also partially explain the differences in firm outcomes.(cont.) While firm size in terms of employees is roughly similar, the MIT firms are much larger in revenues than the Tsinghua firms. It is clear that the broader environment exerts a strong impact on the outcomes of entrepreneurs, their processes, and their firm outcomes.",

As operator attention is divided across multiple supervisory tasks, there is a need to support the operator's awareness of the state of the tasks for safe and effective task management. This research explores enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This thesis specifically assesses the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of course-deviations or late-arrivals to targets for UAV missions with single and multiple UAVs. In particular, this thesis addresses two questions: (1) when compared with discrete audio, does continuous audio better aid human supervision of UAV operations, and (2) is the effectiveness of the discrete or continuous audio support dependent on operator workload? An experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experiment (MAUVE) test bed with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human supervisory tasks within MAUVE. These continuous alerts were tested against single beep discrete alerts. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator's performance in monitoring single and multiple, semi-autonomous vehicles. The results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be masked by continuous audio, leaving operators reliant on the visual aspects of the display.",

The impact of high heel shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high heel shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high heel shoes to learn and leverage the current high heel shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high heel shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high heel shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel.(cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market.",

The company must be able to identify a clinical need that the product will address and the market must be willing to pay for the new technology. This thesis explores the clinical and market need for an improved shock monitoring technology. Shock occurs when there is not enough blood flow to adequately perfuse the body's organs. In the United States, about 500,000 patients go into sudden shock every year and half of these patients die. For millions of additional patients, shock is the final stage of a terminal disease. Despite advances in many other areas of medicine, shock continues to be a serious, life threatening condition. It is my hypothesis that the limitations of the current monitoring technologies contribute to the high mortality rate associated with shock. In my research, I examined the currently available monitoring technologies and their use for the diagnosis and resuscitation of shock patients. I conducted an extensive review of the scientific literature to identify the limitations of the current monitoring technologies and to understand the challenges of diagnosing and treating shock. To supplement my research, I interviewed clinicians who treat shock patients and scientists who are trying to develop new shock monitoring technologies. The clinicians confirmed that there is a critical need for improved shock monitoring technologies. However, for a new shock monitor to be successful, it will need to address the limitations of the current technologies. A well-designed clinical trial will be necessary to demonstrate that the new technology is sensitive and specific, clinically relevant, and easy to use.",

        "Abstrak": "Antisense oligonucleotides have the potential to selectively inhibit the expression of any gene with a known sequence. Antisense-based therapies are under development for the treatment of infectious diseases as well as complex genetic disorders. Although there have been some remarkable successes, realizing this potential is proving difficult because of problems with oligonucleotide stability, specificity, affinity, and delivery. Each of these limitations has been addressed experimentally through the use of chemically-modified oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide conjugates, with much success in enhancing oligonucleotide efficacy. These early studies have shown that selection of target site, once considered a trivial problem, is critical to the success of antisense strategies. It has become clear that the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides is a strong function of the structure of the target mRNA. Though single-stranded, RNA molecules are typically folded into complex three-dimensional structures, formed primarily by intramolecular Watson-Crick base-pairing. If an oligonucleotide is complementary to a sequence embedded in the three dimensional structure, the oligonucleotide may not be able to bind to its target site and exert its therapeutic effect. Because the majority of the structure of RNA molecules is due to Watson-Crick base-pairing, relatively accurate predictions of these folding interactions can be made from algorithms that locate the structure with the most favorable free energy of folding.(cont.) Taking advantage of the predictability of RNA structures, this thesis addresses the problem of antisense target site selection, first from a theoretical and subsequently an experimental standpoint. A thermodynamic model to predict the binding affinity of oligonucleotides for their target mRNA is described and validated using multiple in vitro and cell-culture based experimental data sets. Subsequently, direct experimental comparisons with theoretical predictions are made on the well-characterized rabbit-[beta]-globin (RBG) mRNA, using a novel, centrifugal, binding affinity assay. The importance of the hybridization kinetics is also explored, as is the role of association kinetics in defining the rate of cleavage by the enzyme ribonuclease H (RNase H). Finally, the applicability of the model in identifying biologically active oligonucleotides is demonstrated.",

        "Abstrak": "Evidence suggests that morphological changes of neuroanatomical structures may reflect abnormalities in neurodevelopment, or relate to a variety of disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Advances in high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques allow us to study these alterations of brain structures in vivo. Previous work in studying the shape variations of brain structures has provided additional localized information compared with traditional volume-based study. However, challenges remain in finding an accurate shape presentation and conducting shape analysis with sound statistical principles. In this work, we develop methods for automatically extracting localized and multi-scale shape features and conducting statistical shape analysis of neuroanatomical structures obtained from MR images. We first develop a procedure to extract multi-scale shape features of brain structures using biorthogonal spherical wavelets. Using this wavelet-based shape representation, we build multi-scale shape models and study the localized cortical folding variations in a normal population using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We then build a shape-based classification framework for detecting pathological changes of cortical surfaces using advanced classification methods, such as predictive Automatic Relevance Determination (pred-ARD), and demonstrate promising results in patient/control group comparison studies. Thirdly, we develop a nonlinear temporal model for studying the temporal order and regional difference of cortical folding development based on this shape representation. Furthermore, we develop a shape-guided segmentation method to improve the segmentation of sub-cortical structures, such as hippocampus, by using shape constraints obtained in the wavelet domain.(cont.) Finally, we improve upon the proposed wavelet-based shape representation by adopting a newly developed over-complete spherical wavelet transformation and demonstrate its utility in improving the accuracy and stability of shape representations. By using these shape representations and statistical analysis methods, we have demonstrated promising results in localizing shape changes of neuroanatomical structures related to aging, neurological diseases, and neurodevelopment at multiple spatial scales. Identification of these shape changes could potentially lead to more accurate diagnoses and improved understanding of neurodevelopment and neurological diseases.",

This thesis evaluates the usage of solid aluminum sulfate as a means to achieving national effluent regulations in Imhoff tanks in the municipality of Las Vegas, Santa Barbara. The report contains a brief background on both Imhoff tanks and chemically enhanced primary treatment and a discussion of the governing technical considerations. The residents of Las Vegas produce a very high amount of relatively dilute domestic wastewater (approximately 1,000 liters/person/day). Bench scale testing and pilot testing during January 2008 in the Las Vegas Imhoff tanks found that a dosage of approximately 150 mg/l alum (17% Al2O3) was necessary to treat Las Vegas? domestic wastewater. However, solution preparation and chemical injection were found to be difficult to achieve under current conditions and the cost of alum in this quantity is prohibitively expensive. The final recommendations to the municipality of Las Vegas include encouragement to conserve water and a comprehensive plan to better maintain the Imhoff tanks in order to achieve higher levels of treatment. This thesis also documents the author's efforts to ascertain the status of Imhoff tanks in the rest of Honduras in terms of their size, design, and maintenance. During January 2008 three other Imhoff tanks in the department of Santa Barbara and one in the department of La Paz were visited and all were found to be in varied states of disrepair.

        "Abstrak": "This thesis reviews the jet grouting methodology, and the current state of practice and research. Current methods of prediction of jet grout diameters are highly empirical and site specific, and do not take into account the jet hydrodynamics and soil properties explicitly. A rational model to describe the jet excavation mechanism for cohesive soil is presented in this thesis, with the aim of providing an improved prediction tool that can be used in jetting design. The model is based on the assumption that the velocity distribution in the cutting jet is equivalent to that of a free jet with boundaries corresponding to the dimensions of the cavity excavated in the ground. The shape of the cavity formed depends on the erosional properties of the soil and jet expansion is limited by the resistance at the jet-soil interface. It is hypothesized that the shape of the cavity excavated follows the locus of the jet radius satisfying the condition of constant wall shear stress. The model predicts that the limit of jet penetration is reached when the dynamic pressure at the jet tip becomes equal to the ultimate soil bearing resistance. The model was validated by laboratory jetting tests, using soil specimens manufactured from powdered kaolin clay, cement and water. Cement-soil ratios (CSR) of 2.5 to 7.5% were used to produce specimens with undrained shear strength (Su) ranging from 5 to 45 kPa. A period of at least 3 days was allowed for the specimen to cure in the test tank before jetting was commenced. The tests were conducted using different nozzle diameters, jetting pressures, rotation speeds and soil strengths. The specimens were exhumed after completion of each test to map the shape of the cuts excavated.(cont.) The insitu shear strength of the specimens was obtained using torvane and laboratory vane shear tests. Samples were also obtained for density and moisture content measurements. The experimental results showed that the measured and predicted shapes of cut were in reasonable agreement, with the predicted jet width being conservative in most cases. A strong linear correlation was found between jet penetration, nozzle diameter, nozzle pressure difference and soil bearing capacity. It was found that a bearing capacity coefficient (Sc) of 2.4 was applicable for failure at the jet tip. This value of Sc was corroborated by field trial data. Wall shear stresses back-calculated from the experiments were much smaller than the residual soil strengths obtained from laboratory vane shear tests and correspond more closely to the erosional strength of clays. The model enables the lift step of the jetting monitor to be computed directly. The present research demonstrated that valuable information regarding the excavation mechanism can be obtained by careful examination of the actual cut in a soil formed by a jet. It is recommended that further work be done to investigate the erosional process at the jet-soil interface and the properties of the grouted soil, using higher jetting pressures and soils with higher shear strengths. The effect of withdrawal rate on column formation and uniformity of mix is of interest. The brittleness of the grouted product and its effect on strength and deformation behavior is also important.",

        "Abstrak": "Hydrogen is the viable energy carrier of future energy and transportation systems due to its clean emissions, light weight, and abundance. Its extremely low volumetric density, however, presents significant challenges to storage onboard vehicles. The study involves a survey of the current state of direct hydrogen storage technologies-cryogenic, compressed, and liquid storage-and an analysis of the problems associated with its storage. The significant storage problems that are reviewed and analyzed are issues with cool-down, boil-off, dormancy, materials, and space limitations. The goal of this study is to ultimately provide design insights on storage tanks, whether they be built for thermal performance (insulated), mechanical performance (pressure vessels), or both. The critical parameter that is analyzed is the inner shell wall thickness, or the layer that holds and encompasses the fuel. Graphs were provided to illustrate the reliance of the aforementioned problems on inner shell wall thickness. The results show that-given current materials-a nominal thickness of 10 cm is appropriate for liquid storage and a thickness of 4 cm is appropriate for flexibly fuelled storage and cryogenic compressed storage mechanisms.(cont.) Additionally, the performance of these storage mechanisms was also projected for potential future materials. The conclusions were that more research needs to be dedicated into two broad areas: thermally-efficient insulation and stronger pressure vessel materials.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is a collection of essays that uses theoretical and experimental methods to explore institutional persistence, contract structure, and authority. Chapter One studies the informational and efficiency properties of institutions that form to reduce moral hazard. While in the short run such mechanisms may be optimal, in the long run inefficient institutions may persist because information about changes in the underlying environment is lost. Using experimental and theoretical methods, it analyzes a market with high quality and low quality products that are indistinguishable without a costly certification process. Sellers in the market make endogenous production decisions and are heterogeneous in their levels of moral hazard leading to two possible equilibria-non-certifying and certifying-that vary in both efficiency and information about the underlying environment. The certifying equilibrium, which does not carry information about changes in the distribution of sellers, does not adjust when the underlying environment changes, perpetuating a market structure that makes all market participants weakly worse off. Chapter Two studies how changes in contract structure may help preserve antiquities. Most countries prohibit the export of certain antiquities. This practice often leads to illegal excavation and looting for the black market, which damages objects and destroys important aspects of the archaeological record. Chapter Two argues that many of the goals for export bans could be better accomplished through the use of long-term leases which would raise revenue for the country of origin while preserving national long-term ownership rights. Chapter Three uses experiments to study how control rights are distributed in a setting with incentive conflicts.(cont.) It shows that while effort levels are consistent with theoretical predictions, principals retain control rights even when it is strongly in their interest to delegate. Chapter Three also documents a differential response to authority by gender. As agents, women have strong fairness preferences resulting in diminished effort in asymmetric treatments but higher effort in symmetric ones. As principals, women are more likely to transfer authority when it is efficient to do so.",

        "Abstrak": "Building Information Systems (IS) requires employees to have a clear understanding of not only the daily work of the company, but of value delivery mechanisms throughout the firm. The three major success factors for IS projects are: user involvement, executive management support and a clear statement of requirements according to the Standish Group (The Standish Group International, 1994). Identifying these factors requires a holistic understanding of the organization. Existing literature contains numerous frameworks for the analysis of organizational structure, management guidelines, and strategic decision making processes of service organizations. This thesis uses system architecture, a Systems Engineering methodology involving the analysis of the entire firm, to study a consulting, engineering, construction and operations (CECO) service company. The resulting architecture document provides a model of the organization that is useful in the evaluation, justification, and definition phases of internal information technology (IT) projects. The model combines, in a single document, the firm's beneficiaries and goals and the functions, processes and forms created within the firm to achieve those goals. Results show that, when an internal IT project is proposed, the idea can be projected onto the system architectural model to clarify the proposal's support for organizational goals and functions and therefore, discern the project's value. During the early design phases of the internal IT project, the model helps identify stakeholders, beneficiaries, related existing systems, scope and needs. The model contributes to the project by determining value and by providing the three most important factors of project success; identification of users, stakeholders and requirements.",

        "Abstrak": "Aneuploidy is an unbalanced cell state associated with developmental conditions such as Down syndrome (DS) as well as cancer, a disease of rapid proliferation. Studies of yeast, mouse and human cells harboring one extra chromosome have demonstrated that aneuploid cells show a number of common phenotypes in vitro, notably decreased proliferation. However, the precise role of aneuploidy in cancer has yet to be elucidated, in part due to lack of systematic in vivo model systems. Furthermore, evaluation of aneuploidy-associated phenotypes in vivo has been difficult because autosomal trisomy is generally embryonic lethal in mice. Here, I have evaluated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from three aneuploid mouse models in vivo, two models of autosomal trisomy and one model of chromosome instability. By performing hematopoietic reconstitutions, I found that aneuploid HSCs have a range of fitness in vivo that correlates with the amount of extra DNA in each line. My results demonstrate that aneuploidy-associated cellular phenotypes are observed in vivo and in the context of a euploid organism. Additionally, I found that aneuploidy is well tolerated in the hematopoietic lineage under normal conditions in two of the three mouse models analyzed. However, even these relatively fit aneuploid cells begin to show more severe phenotypes upon repeated proliferative challenge. In humans, DS is associated with perturbations in the hematopoietic system, often resulting in childhood leukemia. Trisomy is also frequently observed in non-DS leukemias. Establishment of this model system enables future systematic dissection of the source of aneuploidy-associated fitness defects in vivo both in hematopoiesis and in the context of cancer.",

        "Abstrak": "Cellular genetic information is encoded in DNA. The passage of this information from DNA to proteins is regulated at multiple levels and each level gives cells the chance to control the structure and function of their components. Transcriptional regulation is an important part of this multi-level process. By using feedback loops as part of transcriptional gene networks, cells can tune the level and stability of gene expression. In the first half of my thesis, I will discuss how isogenic cells can be re-programmed to have varying levels of memory associated with previous growth conditions and how genetic noise limits the stability of this cellular memory. Noise in gene expression, through the phenotypic heterogeneity it promotes, has the potential to be a mechanism implemented by cells to cope with the uncertainties in environmental conditions. By randomly expressing multiple phenotypes, each fit to a certain environment, cells can survive unexpected changes in the extracellular environment. In this way, a population can hedge its bets against environmental uncertainty. Depending on how often the cells choose to display various phenotypes, the population can range from being highly diverse (heterogeneous) to being less diverse (homogeneous). In the second half of my thesis, I will discuss how the degree of phenotypic diversity for an isogenic population of cells can be tuned by re-engineering a gene network. I will present results from experiments which test the effect of noise-induced diversity on population fitness in the presence of fluctuating environments. The results demonstrate that for an optimum population growth in fluctuating environments, cells need to match the rates of inter-phenotypic switching to the frequency of environmental changes.",

        "Abstrak": "Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is under investigation as a treatment option in patients with resistant hypertension (RH). Determinants of arterial compliance may, however, help to predict the BP response to therapy. Aortic distensibility (AD) is a well-established parameter of aortic stiffness and can reliably be obtained by CMR. This analysis sought to investigate the effects of RDN on AD and to assess the predictive value of pre-treatment AD for BP changes. We analyzed data of 65 patients with RH included in a multicenter trial. RDN was performed in all participants. A standardized CMR protocol was utilized at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. AD was determined as the change in cross-sectional aortic area per unit change in BP. Office BP decreased significantly from 173/92 ± 24/16 mmHg at baseline to 151/85 ± 24/17 mmHg (p < 0.001) 6 months after RDN. Maximum aortic areas increased from 604.7 ± 157.7 to 621.1 ± 157.3 mm[superscript 2] (p = 0.011). AD improved significantly by 33% from 1.52 ± 0.82 to 2.02 ± 0.93 × 10[superscript −3] mmHg[superscript −1] (p < 0.001). Increase of AD at follow-up was significantly more pronounced in younger patients (p = 0.005) and responders to RDN (p = 0.002). Patients with high-baseline AD were significantly younger (61.4 ± 10.1 vs. 67.1 ± 8.4 years, p = 0.022). However, there was no significant correlation of baseline AD to response to RDN. AD is improved after RDN across all age groups. Importantly, these improvements appear to be unrelated to observed BP changes, suggesting that RDN may have direct effects on the central vasculature.

        "Abstrak": "We present a 7 yr timing study of the 2.5 ms X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, an X-ray transient with a recurrence time of =2 yr, using data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer covering 4 transient outbursts (1998-2005). Substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic, was observed during each outburst. Analysis of the systematic pulse shape changes suggests that, as an outburst dims, the X-ray \"hot spot\" on the pulsar surface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. The overall pulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolution within a given X-ray outburst (and calls previous zi measurements of this source into question), with typical upper limits of Jil < 2.5 x 10-14 Hz s-1 (2a). However, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6 a) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a rate /i = (-5.6 ± 2.0) x 10-16 Hz s-1, with most of the spin evolution occurring during X-ray quiescence. We discuss the possible contributions of magnetic propeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation to the measured spin down, setting an upper limit of B < 1.5 x 108 G for the pulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and Q < 4.4 x 1036 g cm2 for the mass quadrupole moment. We also measured an orbital period derivative of Porb = (3.5 + 0.2) x 10-12 s s-1 We identify a strong anti-correlation between the fractional amplitude of the harmonic (r2) and the X-ray flux (fx) in the persistent pulsations of four sources: SAX J1808.4-3658, IGR J00291+5934, and XTE J1751-305, XTE J1807-294. These sources exhibit a powerlaw relationship r2 x( fx7 with slopes ranging from y = -0.47 to -0.70. The three other accreting millisecond pulsars that we analyzed, XTE J0929-314, XTE J1814-338, and HETE J1900.1-2455, do not as fully explore a wide range of fluxes, but they too seem to obey a similar relation. We argue that these trends may be evidence of the recession of the accretion disk as the outbursts dim. We examine the energy dependence of the persistent pulsations and thermonuclear burst oscillations from SAX J1808.4-3658.We confirm the soft phase lags previously discovered from this source, and we discover that these phase lags increase as the source flux decays slowly following its peak flux. When the source decay becomes rapid and the outburst enters its flaring tail stage, this relationship reverses, and the phase lags diminish as the flux dims further. This result, along with the pulse profile changes observed at the beginning of the flairing tail stage, suggests an abrupt change in the geometry of the accretion disk and column at this time in the outburst. In contrast, the thermonuclear burst oscillation timing does not show appreciable lags, and the burst oscillation phases and fractional amplitudes appear to be relatively independent of energy.",

        "Abstrak": "The ground state for a one dimensional spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain coupled to phonons is a dimerized singlet state known as a \"spin-Peierls\" state. Currently, the spin-Peierls state is realized in only a handful of known compounds. Even after decades of scientific scrutiny, there is an absence of direct measurements of the lattice dynamics associated with the transition. In this work we present an extensive study of a new one dimensional spin-Peierls compound, TiOC1. The magnetic susceptibility strongly indicates a singlet ground state, with two apparent anomalies observed at T, ,=65 K and Tc2=92 K. Specific heat measurements have been performed and the associated entropy changes quantified. The 65 K transition exhibits a thermal hysteresis, indicative of a first order phase transition. A detailed synchrotron x-ray study of the structure reveals the appearance of superlattice peaks at ( ... ) below 65 K. The intensity of the peaks drop very sharply above T, and a thermal hysteresis is observed which is consistent with a first order phase transition at 65 K. We find that the temperature region between 65 K and 92 K is characterized by a novel incommensurate state. The incommensurate reflections appear at ( ... ). The temperature dependence of the intensity of the incommensurate peaks shows a more gradual onset, with no thermal hysteresis. The incommensurate wavevectors change continuously as a function of temperature and can be analyzed in terms of a mean field theory of phase shifted discommensurations. The observation of the third harmonics enabled a careful characterization of the underlying real space superstructure. We find that all of the observed scattering can be reproduced by a one dimensional long-wavelength modulation of a locally dimerized structure.(cont.) The lattice dynamics above T 2were characterized by inelastic x-ray scattering measurements. By analyzing the data in terms of a damped harmonic oscillator response function, we are able to extract the phonon frequency and damping for all observed modes. We find a longitudinal acoustic phonon branch whose damping increases for q-vectors close to the zone boundary, which is also associated with an apparent softening of the frequency. Both of these anharmonic effects increase as T2 is approached, and are consistent with a soft phonon description of the dimerization. The anomalous phonon damping and softening are then analyzed using the Cross & Fisher theory of spin-phonon interaction leading to a spin-Peierls transition. We find that the theory succeeds in describing the data for a narrow temperature range about Tc2, for q near the zone boundary. It does not account for the anharmonic effects observed at high temperatures. Our experimental analysis represents one of the most in-depth quantitative tests of the Cross & Fisher theory to date. In addition our results suggest that TiOCl is a particularly ideal realization of a spin-Peierls system.",

        "Abstrak": "High power, high frequency gyrotrons used in plasma heating must achieve the highest possible efficiency in order to reduce system size and cost and to minimize thermal and mechanical problems. This thesis presents an experimental study of efficiency enhancement in a 1.5 MW, 110 GHz gyrotron oscillator, which operated at 50 % efficiency with a single-stage depressed collector. We present the design and detailed experimental results of a new low ohmic loss cavity, a four-mirror internal mode converter and a single-stage depressed collector. The low ohmic loss TE22,6 cavity, designated \"V-2005\", was designed using the code MAGY to have a Q factor of 830, which would be suitable for CW operation in an industrial gyrotron. The cavity was first tested in the axial configuration, in which the output waveguide also serves as the electron beam collector. In 3 microsecond pulsed operation at 97 kV and 40 A, an output power of 1.67 MW at an efficiency of 42 % was obtained without a depressed collector. The V-2005 cavity efficiency exceeds that of the older \"V-2003\" cavity by 5 percentage points. The enhanced efficiency of the V-2005 cavity may be understood by analyzing the start-up scenario of the cavities. During start-up, the V-2003 cavity suffers from strong mode competition with the TE19,7 mode, resulting in a relatively low efficiency, while the V-2005 cavity has an absence of such mode competition. The experimental mode maps (regions of oscillation vs. magnetic field) obtained for the two cavities are in excellent agreement with the start-up simulations. Following the axial configuration experiments, the experiment was rebuilt with an internal mode converter consisting of a launcher and 4 mirrors, and with a single-stage depressed collector. An output power of 1.5 MW was measured. The internal mode converter operated at 90 % efficiency. When the depressed collector was run at 25 kV, an overall efficiency of 50 % was achieved. An aftercavity interaction (ACI) was investigated as a possible cause of efficiency reduction in the gyrotron.(cont.) The ACI occurs when the spent electron beam interacts at cyclotron resonance with the traveling output microwave beam in a region of lower magnetic field just after the cavity. The presence of the ACI was identified from the comparison between simulation results and the measurement of the depression voltage as a function of beam current. Future research should consider ways of eliminating the ACI, ways of improving the internal mode converter, and the use of a two-stage depressed collector.",

Then, I present three new results relating to various models of quantum computation: a scheme for improving the intrinsic fault tolerance of adiabatic quantum computers using quantum error detecting codes, a proof that a certain problem of estimating Jones polynomials is complete for the one clean qubit complexity class, and a generalization of perturbative gadgets which allows k-body interactions to be directly simulated using 2-body interactions. Lastly, I discuss general principles regarding quantum computation that I learned in the course of my research, and using these principles I propose directions for future research.",

        "Abstrak": "Silicon germanium layers on silicon substrates (SiGe/Si) are useful for a variety of microelectronics applications. The most successful technique for growing low defect density relaxed SiGe/Si layers is relaxed compositional grading. However, with increasing Ge content in the graded SiGe layers, the following materials concerns need to be addressed-{i) a high surface roughness, (ii) the formation of dislocation pile-ups, (iii) an increase in the threading dislocation density, (iv) tensile strains and micro-cracking due to thermal mismatch, and (v) particulate contamination from germane gas phase nucleation.  We have grown relaxed graded SiGe/Si layers using ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD) at growth temperatures ranging between 500°-900° C and pressures between 30-500 millitorr. The SiGe growth rates at different temperature and Ge content regimes agree with previously proposed theories.  By applying both a dislocation blocking criterion and surface roughness effects to graded SiGe/Si structures, we have proposed a model to explain and predict the formation of dislocation pile-ups in graded structures.  We have discovered that there is a substantial improvement in the surface roughness and dislocation pile-up density in graded SiGe layers by growing on miscut Si(00l) substrates. It was found that the array of 60° dislocations that usually forms to relieve the misfit stress could transform into a novel lower energy hexagonal dislocation network consisting of all edge dislocations. High resolution X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that there is a decrease in the rate of epilayer tilting in the Ge-rich layers of the graded buffer in agreement with the observed dislocation structure.  We have designed an optimized relaxed buffer (ORB) process that allows us to grow high quality Ge layers on Si substrates. By employing a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and regrowth step within the epitaxial structure, we have minimized the formation of dislocation pile-ups. Compressive strain has been incorporated into the graded layers to overcome the thermal mismatch problem. The ORB process eliminates dislocation pile-ups, decreases gas-phase nucleation of particles, and eliminates the increase in threading dislocation density.  Germanium p-n photodiodes were fabricated to assess the diectronic quality and prove the feasibility of a high quality infrared detector on a Si substrate. The dark current in the diodes was at least two orders of magnitude lower than any previously reported value for Ge photodiodes on Si substrates. Capacitance measurements indicate that the devices are capable of high speed operation.  Dislocation filtering experiments were conducted to reduce threading dislocation densities on pattered mesas. It was found that at the strain levels from small compressive mismatch, dislocation nucleation from the mesa edges dominates over dislocation filtering.",

        "Abstrak": "The urban library has persisted as a cultural entity, largely because its interiorized form functions as a vault, creating a clear, although often intimidating, boundary between library program and the public realm. While preserved in its laudable functions, the library has met significant challenges with the emergence of new forms of media and technology. The introduction of the television, and more importantly the internet, as popular means of gathering information translates into a complete transformation of the acquisition process into mere fleeting engagements with mass media. The viewpoints and opinions of those few who shape the media are imparted upon the masses. In comparison, the library presents information not only with the benefit of multiple perspectives, but also with the necessary context provided through related subject matters. The challenge therefore becomes one of making available to the general public the great wealth of intellectual resources that the library provides. While some recent library designs have experimented with using the library's very competition to save it from extinction and have essentially contaminated the library with programs from outside the \"vault,\" these attempts have for the most part been unsuccessful.(cont.) The key to reinventing the urban library, I argue, is structuring a new relationship between the highly sensory and immediate experience of the media and the comprehensive material the library has to offer. The crucial bridge between these seemingly disparate methods of acquiring information is the act of browsing. The curiosity that an individual has in one subject matter branches out to create an entirely new area of understanding and ends in a new ability to generate particular opinions. The new urban library therefore becomes structured as an urban interface to facilitate the act of browsing. The community becomes involved in all aspects of the organization of the library so that the interface reflects the very interests of the various constituencies who pass through the library on a daily basis. The library may no longer bear a precise resemblance to libraries of old, stoic reading rooms and monumental facades, but the objectives of this institution will persist for the benefit of future generations.",

It has been argued that whether the capital city should be modernized or has its most historical characteristics preserved as much as possible, and place development elsewhere. The development in the old city of Beijing in the last decade, however, has been mainly driven by speed and economy and has expended very little effort on slow transformation and preservation. The traditional form - the differentiated courtyard architecture and the \"hutong\" neighborhood structure - has gradually been replaced by monolithic separated forms and wide roads under modernization. Through designing a current urban renewal project in the old city of Beijing, this thesis explores alternative ways to deal with transformation in the city, in order to discover the potential of other new urban forms that are not commonly used in the current development in Beijing, but yet hold the value and characteristics of traditional Chinese urban space and could preserve Beijing's identity. This thesis also explores possible ways to construct a new fabric that harmonizes with the old one. The old fabric represents a pattern of living that has been slowly transformed since the Yuan Dynasty (13th - 14th century); thus, it holds a strong identity and memory of Beijing. This thesis will deal with the challenge of preserving identity and memory in a fast-changing environment.",

More than 4,000,000 radial teleseismic traces from about 8,000 events (mb >= 5.8) between 1990 and 2015, globally recorded by one or more of a total ~27,000 receivers, were collected from IRIS-DMC. All of the traces were automatically band-pass filtered (10s to 50s), rotated, clustered, deconvoluted, and finally migrated to structural reflectivity profiles using reference wavespeeds according to the iasp91 model. We compare the 2D and 3D imaging results beneath the Pacific subduction zones and the non-subducting regions, including the southeastern Pacific and Hawaii, focusing on the positive velocity contrast above the CMB that might delineate the D\" discontinuity. We observe broad zones of scatter surfaces, which may indicate multiple-interface post-perovskite phase transitions caused by compositionally differentiated subducted lithosphere. Furthermore, we observe a sharp change in the proposed multiple-interface structure regarding the total number of positive interfaces, the intervals, and the overall pattern of the anomalies from the subduction zones to the non-subducting regions. Such structural complexity implies: (1) the presence of old (at least 180 Ma) subducted material layer of either continental or oceanic lithosphere under the whole Pacific Ocean; and (2) spatial variations in iron, magnesium, and silica components in the subducted lithosphere. Understanding the possible relationship between observed complexity and composition requires further interdisciplinary research.",

Increasing demands for integration of surface mount components, greater use of portable electronic devices, and miniaturized medical diagnostic devices have given rise to the need for methods of fabricating and assembling micron-scale discrete components. Development of reliable non-contact assembly methods requires thorough understanding of electro-mechanics, surface adhesion, and gravitational forces acting on micron- scale objects. The impact of such a study will spread beyond microelectronics, and will also have broad significance in the development of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for diverse applications such as biological assays, drug delivery devices, and tools for high throughput combinatorial materials development. This thesis will discuss methods for and challenges in fabrication, manipulation, and assembly of discrete micron-scale objects. The impact of these issues will be illustrated for the development of a micro-dispensing system used to manipulate microgram quantities of dry granular substances for combinatorial materials development. This method provides a model system to explore the forces on micron-scale objects, and is important in its own right as it will introduce a new range of materials that may benefit from combinatorial development. The applicability of traditional methods for computing dielectrophoretic forces on micron scale objects in the presence of spatially non-uniform electric fields will be discussed for the case of closely-spaced, interacting spheres.(cont.) A dipole approximation model will be presented to quantitatively illustrate the limitations of existing techniques for calculating these forces, and to aid in explaining the observed motion of multiple interacting particles.",

        "Abstrak": "Human [gamma]D crystallin (H[gamma]D-Crys) and human [gamma]S crystallin (H[gamma]S-Crys), are major proteins of the human eye lens and are components of cataracts. H[gamma]D-Crys is expressed early in life in the lens cortex while H[gamma]S-Crys is expressed throughout life in the lens epithelial cells. Both are primarily β-sheet proteins made up of four Greek keys separated into two domains and display 69% sequence similarity. The unfolding and refolding of H[gamma]D-Crys and H[gamma]S-Crys have been characterized as a function of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentration at neutral pH and 37⁰C, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to monitor in vitro folding. Equilibrium unfolding and refolding experiments with GdnHCl showed unfolded protein is more fluorescent than its native counter-part despite the absence of metal or ion-tryptophan interactions in both of these proteins. This fluorescence quenching may influence the lens response to ultraviolet light radiation or the protection of the retina from ambient ultraviolet damage. Wild-type H[gamma]D-Crys exhibited reversible refolding above 1.0 M GdnHCl. Aggregation of refolding intermediates of H[gamma]D-Crys was observed in both equilibrium and kinetic refolding processes. The aggregation pathway competed with productive refolding at denaturant concentrations below 1.0 M GdnHCl, beyond the major conformational transition region. H[gamma]S-Crys, however, exhibited a two-state reversible unfolding and refolding with no evidence of aggregation. Atomic force microscopy of H[gamma]D-Crys samples under aggregating conditions revealed ordered fiber structures that could recruit H[gamma]S-Crys to the aggregate. To provide fluorescence reporters(cont.) for each quadrant of H[gamma]D-Crys, triple mutants each containing three tryptophan to phenylalanine substitutions and one native tryptophan have been constructed and expressed. Trp68-only and Trp 156-only retained the quenching pattern of wild-type H[gamma]D-Crys. During equilibrium refolding/unfolding, the tryptophan fluorescence signals indicated that domain I (W42-only and W68-only) unfolded at lower concentrations of GdnHCl than domain II (W130-only and W156-only). Kinetic analysis of both the unfolding and refolding of the triple mutant tryptophan proteins identified an intermediate along the H[gamma]D-Crys folding pathway with domain I unfolded and domain II intact. This species is a candidate for the partially folded intermediate in the in vitro aggregation pathway of H[gamma]D-Crys. An N143D deamination post-translational modification has recently been identified in H[gamma]S-Crys that is present in high concentrations in insoluble protein removed from cataractous lenses. The presence of the N143D mutation did not significantly affect the equilibrium or kinetic properties of H[gamma]S-Crys indicating that this mutation is unlikely to be involved in protein destabilization during cataract formation in vivo. The method in which H[gamma]D-Crys aggregates on its own and engages neighboring molecules in the polymerization process in vitro may provide insight into the process of cataractogenesis in vivo.",

        "Abstrak": "Predicting macroscopic properties of materials starting from an atomistic or electronic level description can be a formidable task due to the many orders of magnitude in length and time scales that need to be spanned. A characteristic of successful approaches to this problem is the systematic coarse-graining of less relevant degrees of freedom in order to obtain Hamiltonians that span larger length and time scale. Attempts to do this in the static regime (i.e. zero temperature) have already been developed, as well as thermodynamical models where all the internal degrees of freedom are removed. In this thesis, we present an approach that leads to a dynamics for thermodynamic-coarse-grained models. This allows us to obtain temperature-dependent and transport properties. The renormalization group theory is used to create new local potential models between nodes, within the approximation of local thermodynamical equilibrium. Assuming that these potentials give an averaged description of node dynamics, we calculate thermal and mechanical properties. If this method can be sufficiently generalized it may form the basis of a Multiscale Molecular Dynamics method with time and spatial coarse-graining. In the second part of the thesis, we analyze the problem of crystal structure prediction, by using quantum calculations.(cont.) This is a fundamental problem in materials research and development, and it is typically addressed with highly accurate quantum mechanical computations on a small set of candidate structures, or with empirical rules that have been extracted from a large amount of experimental information, but have limited predictive power. In this thesis, we transfer the concept of heuristic rule extraction to a large library of ab-initio calculated information, and demonstrate that this can be developed into a tool for crystal structure prediction. In addition, we analyze the ab-initio results and prediction for a large number of transition-metal binary alloys.",

        "Abstrak": "High Tc, cuprates have a number of features that are anomalous from the point of view of the conventional theory of metals, i.e. the Fermi liquid theory. These include the high Tc itself, the linear resistivity in optimally doped cuprates, the \"spin gap\" phenomena, and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Some of the basic features of the high Tc, phase diagram can be readily understood from slave boson mean field theories of the t-J model that yield a variety of phases like the uRVB phase (strange metal), d-wave RVB phase (spin gap), and the superconducting phase. This thesis is concerned with improving this picture by considering important fluctuations around the mean fields. This leads to certain gauge theories in which neutral spin 1/2 fermions (\"spinons\") and charged spinless bosons (\"holons\") are coupled to gauge fields. If the gauge field is not \"confining\", the spin and charge degrees of freedom are separated to some extent, and an unconventional picture for transport and magnetic properties is expected. Following an introduction and overview, the first half of the main body of this thesis analyzes a simple model of a degenerate two-dimensional Bose liquid interacting with a fluctuating gauge field, with the goal of studying the charge degree of freedom in the cuprates. It is shown that the fluctuating gauge field efficiently destroys superfluidity even in the Bose degenerate regime. The nature of the resulting normal state is discussed in terms of the geometric properties of the imaginary-time paths of the bosons. Charge response functions are studied numerically (by path integral Monte Carlo methods); it is found that the transport scattering rate behaves as ... , consistent with the experiments on the cuprates in the normal state, and that the density correlations of our model resemble the charge correlations of the t-J model. The second half considers the magnetic properties of cuprates from the point of view of a gauge theory of spinons, with emphasis on the underdoped regime. Despite the spin gap, there is a substantial antiferromagnetic correlation in the underdoped cuprates, as evidenced by the q-space scan of Neutron scattering cross section and different temperature dependences of the Copper and Oxygen site relaxation rates, features which are not captured well by mean field theories. As a concrete illustration of the gauge-fluctuation restoration of the antiferromangetic correlation and the feasibility of the 1/N perturbation theory, a U(1) gauge theory of id Heisenberg spin chain is worked out exactly, and then perturbatively. The difference between the behavior of uniform and staggerd spin correlation functions is discussed in terms of conserved and nonconserved currents. The 1/N-perturbative treatment of the gauge theory in 2+1D (which can be motivated from the mean field Flux phase of the Heisnberg model) leads to a dynamical mass generation corresponding to an antiferromagnetic ordering, but it is argued that in a similar gauge theory with an additional coupling to a Bose (holon) field, symmetry breaking does not occur, but antiferromagnetic correlations are improved, which is the situation in the underdoped cuprates.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is a theoretical and experimental study of inter-Landau level transitions in n-type InSb. Three main topics are considered: (i) The first observation was made of a magnetic field reversal effect in a spin-conserving inter-Landau level absorption transition. (ii) Advancements were made in the theory of intraband absorption and scattering processes. (iii) Experiments were carried out on the spin-flip Raman laser to examine crystal anisotropy. An important feature of this research is the prediction and observation of a striking magnetic field reversal effect in the inter-Landau level magnetoabsorption in n-InSb. The magnitude of the absorption associated with two transitions is observed to change by a factor of nearly 3 upon reversal of magnetic field direction. The effect results from the inversion asymmetry of the tetrahedral zincblende structure. The transitions which show the effect are the double cyclotron resonance and the double cyclotron resonance combined with spin-flip. The reversal effect involves the interference between two matrix elements which contribute to the absorption, one having tetrahedral symmetry, and the other spherical symmetry. The tetrahedral matrix element results from the inversion-asymmetry mechanism. The isotropic matrix element is associated with the wave vector-dependent electric quadrupole EQ and magnetic dipole MD absorption. The isotropic matrix element changes sign on reversal of q, and the one for inversion asymmetry changes sign on reversal of B, so the interference term changes sign on reversal of either q or B. Stimulated spin-flip Raman (SFR) scattering has been studied in applied magnetic fields up to 18 T. For 10-[mu]m pumping, the SFR laser output is dominated by structure associated with linear intraband absorption and shows significant anisotropy with regard to crystal orientation in the applied field. Calculations have been made for the transition matrix elements and absorption coefficients for the anisotropic intra-conduction-band magneto-optical transitions. The theory includes warping-induced transitions and the effects of band nonparabolicity in the Pidgeon and Brown model. Reasonable agreement between theory and experiment is obtained.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis investigates the hydrodynamic effects of biologically-inspired leading-edge tubercles. Two complementary studies examine the performance of three-dimensional hydrofoils based on the pectoral flippers of the Humpback whale (novangilae megaptera). The first study uses a static foil, with application to conventional control surfaces--such as rudders or dive planes--found on marine vehicles. The second study uses a dynamic foil, with application to flapping foil propulsion. The lift and drag characteristics of foils with and without tubercles are compared using force measurements from experiments conducted in a water tunnel at four Reynolds numbers between 4.4 x 104 and 1.2 x 105. Results from these experiments indicate the foils stall from the trailing edge in the range of Reynolds numbers tested. Stall was delayed on the foil with tubercles; maximum lift was reduced in all cases but the highest Re. PIV flow visualization at Re = 8.9 x 104 showed flow separation at the trailing edge of both foils as attack angle was increased, confirming that the foils were in trailing edge stall. Surface normal vorticity in ensemble averaged flow fields showed distinct pairs of opposite sign vortical structures being generated by the tubercles, providing some insight into the fluid dynamic mechanism that leads to changes in the performance of a foil with tubercles. Tubercles were used on a flapping foil for the first time. Mean thrust coefficient, CT , power coefficient, CP , and efficiency, n, were measured over a wide parametric space. The maximum thrust coefficient and efficiency measured using the smooth control foil were CT = 3.511 and n = 0.678. The maxima using the tubercled test foil were CT = 3.366 and n = 0.663. In general, the foil with tubercles performed worse than the control, and this performance deficit grew with increased loading.(cont.) These results suggest that the vortical structures generated by the tubercles interfere with the thrust wake generated by flapping, ultimately degrading performance.",

        "Abstrak": "Type I diabetes is a disease that results from a person's impaired ability to produce insulin, a protein that regulates the blood glucose concentration. Insulin is produced by [beta]-cells in the Islets of Langerhans, which are aggregates of cells averaging about 150 [mu]m in diameter and constituting about 1 to 2% of the pancreas volume. The efficacy of islet transplantation as a treatment for diabetes has been demonstrated in humans by the Edmonton Protocol, but obstacles remain for wide scale application. One major issue is that successful islet transplantation requires permanent use of multiple immunosuppressive agents. These agents may have serious side effects as well as a substantial financial burden. Microencapsulation is used for full or partial protection of transplanted islets from immune rejection. However, the microcapsule prevents islet revascularization and creates an additional mass transfer resistance for oxygen transport to islets. This reduced oxygen transfer can lead to a hypoxic core within the islet that results in tissue death and reduced function. We have studied two approaches to enhance microencapsulated islet survival and function by reducing oxygen transport limitations. The first method involves incorporating a perfluorocarbon emulsion into alginate microcapsules to enhance oxygen permeability in order to protect islets from hypoxia. The second method involves dispersing the islets into single cells and allowing them to reaggregate into cell clusters smaller than the original islet. The smaller aggregates are less prone to the development of a necrotic core and can function normally because of adequate oxygen supply and the presence of cell to cell contacts.(cont.) A theoretical reaction-diffusion model was developed to predict the oxygen partial pressure profile, extent of cell death, and rate of insulin secretion in alginate microcapsules or planar diffusion chambers containing an islet, islet cell aggregates, and dispersed single cells exposed to specified external PO2 values, with or without PFC. Results show that hypoxic conditions are reduced, therefore enhancing islet viability and substantially maintaining insulin secretion when PFC emulsion is incorporated in the encapsulation material or when smaller islet cell aggregates are used. Methods were developed to assess encapsulated tissue through nuclei counting, DNA quantification, and oxygen consumption rate measurements. Experiments with islets and islet cell aggregates were performed to assess whether the benefits predicted by the theoretical model can be observed experimentally. After two days of culture in a limited oxygen environment comparisons were made between islets and islet cell aggregates within normal alginate and islets within PFC alginate microcapsules in their viability by measurement of oxygen consumption rate, function by measuring glucose stimulated insulin secretion (only tissue in normal alginate capsules), and total tissue content by measuring DNA or performing nuclei counts. The PFC emulsion formulation that was used was toxic to islets and we were not conclusively able to demonstrate that it enhances survival in low oxygen. Islet cell aggregates survive and function better in low oxygen environments during in vitro experiments than intact islets. Encapsulated rat islet cell aggregates are also found to more effectively cure diabetes in mice than encapsulated islets.",

        "Abstrak": "The problem of accounting for epistemic uncertainty in risk management decisions is conceptually straightforward, but is riddled with practical difficulties. Simple approximations are often used whereby future variations in epistemic uncertainty are ignored or worst-case scenarios are postulated. These strategies tend to produce sub-optimal decisions. We develop a framework based on Bayesian decision theory that accounts for the random temporal evolution of the epistemic uncertainty and minimum safety standards, and illustrate the effects of these factors for the case of optimal seismic design of buildings. Results show that when temporal fluctuations in the epistemic uncertainty and regulatory safety constraints are included, the optimal level of seismic protection exceeds the normative level at the time of construction. We do a sensitivity analysis concerning the repair and retrofit strategies that control the repair actions following earthquake damages and the amount of structural upgrading in the case of non-compliance with the safety standards. We see, that just like the optimal initial design system, upgrades should also be made conservatively to provide a margin of safety against future adverse changes in the epistemic uncertainty and regulations. The optimal degree of conservatism depends in a complex way on the cost of providing additional seismic protection, increase in earnings from additional seismic protection, costs of repairs and upgrading, seismicity of the region and the volatility of both the estimated hazard (due to changes in epistemic uncertainty) and the regulatory environment. The effect of all these influencing factors is studied through an extreme sensitivity analysis. We argue that the optimal Bayesian decisions do not depend on the aleatory or epistemic nature of the uncertainties, but only on the total (epistemic plus aleatory) uncertainty and how that total uncertainty varies randomly during the lifetime of the project.",

        "Abstrak": "The untranslated region (UTR) at the 30 end of a mammalian mRNA is typically rich with regulatory motifs that influence the stability, localization, translation and other properties of the message. We explored two classes of motifs, microRNA (miRNA) complementary sites and cleavage and polyadenylation (poly(A)) signals, and provide evidence that specific sequence contextual features are important for their recognition. MiRNAs are 22 nt, non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional gene regulators in animals and plants. They typically interact with target mRNAs through base-pairing predominantly between bases 2-8 (the 'seed' region) at the 50 end of the miRNA and complementary sites in the target 30 UTR ('seed matches'). These interactions result in target mRNA translational repression or deadenylation, or both. Through analysis of mRNA expression data following miRNA or siRNA overexpression or inhibition, we uncovered novel targeting determinants that influence mRNA levels. These include the presence of distinct seed match types and sequence context, in particular that increased AU content and conservation were independently associated with greater target down-regulation. Our results demonstrate that mRNA fold change increases multiplicatively (i.e., log-additively) with seed match count. We integrated these features into a target scoring scheme, TargetRank, and demonstrated the effectiveness of our rankings in predicting in vivo target responses. Mammalian genes frequently have multiple, competing poly(A) sites, and the features influencing site selection remain poorly understood. Poly(A) site recognition occurs co-transcriptionally and given that transcription is highly influenced by the tight packaging of genomic DNA into chromatin, we investigated the potential impact of nucleosome positioning on poly(A) site usage. Using recent, public, Illumina sequencing data from human nucleosome boundaries, we found evidence that greater nucleosome density in regions flanking but not overlapping poly(A) sites is associated with more frequent usage.",

        "Abstrak": "Aluminum is a versatile material that is used frequently in transportation and packaging, two industries with substantial recent growth. The increase in demand for aluminum, however, has outpaced the growth of primary aluminum production. One way to meet this shortfall is the use of secondary, or recycled, materials which provides both economic and environmental benefits. The increased use of secondary materials is limited by numerous factors; one such factor of concern is uncertainty. One form of uncertainty that all producers face is consumer demand; this will be the focus of this study. The two stage recourse optimization model presented in this thesis aims to provide batch planners with a tool to effectively manage raw materials in an uncertain demand environment. This model enhances existing research by increasing the number of demand scenarios considered by an increase in the model's resolution. The two metrics evaluated are scrap purchased and production cost. The batch planning process is affected by a number of assumptions about factor inputs including the model resolution, salvage value, coefficient of variation, scrap cost and compositional constraints. Results show that understanding the influence of these factors provides producers with the insight and ability to effectively manage and mitigate the effects of demand uncertainty in a cost minimization framework.",

Recent studies have found that only a small number of the genes in human disease-related pathways show consistent dysregulation in sick individuals. However, those studies found that some pathway genes are affected in most sick individuals, but genes can differ among individuals. While a pathway is usually defined as a set of genes known to share a specific function, pathway boundaries are frequently difficult to assign, and methods that rely on such definition cannot discover novel pathways. Protein interaction networks can potentially be used to overcome these problems.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings\r\n\r\nWe present DEGAS (DysrEgulated Gene set Analysis via Subnetworks), a method for identifying connected gene subnetworks significantly enriched for genes that are dysregulated in specimens of a disease. We applied DEGAS to seven human diseases and obtained statistically significant results that appear to home in on compact pathways enriched with hallmarks of the diseases. In Parkinson's disease, we provide novel evidence for involvement of mRNA splicing, cell proliferation, and the 14-3-3 complex in the disease progression. DEGAS is available as part of the MATISSE software package (http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/matisse).\r\nConclusions/Significance\r\n\r\nThe subnetworks identified by DEGAS can provide a signature of the disease potentially useful for diagnosis, pinpoint possible pathways affected by the disease, and suggest targets for drug intervention.",

        "Abstrak": "Central to the study of stratospheric ozone recovery and climate change, is the ability to predict emissions of Montreal Protocol-restricted halocarbons (MPGs) over the coming decades. The prediction of emissions has become difficult as global production of MPGs has rapidly declined establishing \"banks\" (MPGs which have been produced but not yet released) as the main emission sources. Both the magnitude and release rate of global banks is quite uncertain. Very few field studies have been conducted to provide estimates of global bank emissions from individual sources within countries. This thesis provides the first known observation-based estimates of CFC-12, CFC-11,CFC-113, and CH3CCl3 emissions in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. With several hundred MSW landfills in both the US and UK, estimating emissions of MPGs from landfills required a targeted approach. Whole landfill mixing ratios and flow rates were sampled monthly at one landfill in southern Massachusetts to provide temporal coverage. Spatial coverage was achieved through one time sampling at seven landfills in Massachusetts and through data provided by nine UK landfills for CFC-12 and CFC-11. Only actively managed MSW landfills were sampled. US and UK MPG landfill emissions were estimated and compared to recent observation-based estimates of total US and UK MPG emissions to determine the importance of the landfill source. US MPG landfill emissions were estimated to be 0.008 - 0.08 Gg year-1. For all four MPGs, US landfill emissions were 0.6% of total US emissions. The UK landfill emission estimates were 6% and 0.8% of total UK CFC-12 and CFC-11 emissions, respectively. All estimates were accurate to within a factor of 2. This indicates that landfills are not currently a significant source of lingering MPG emissions in the US and UK. The implications are that the majority of MPG emissions in industrialized countries are likely coming from faster emitting sources.",

Both have been created to aid in the leg's generation of a ground reaction force which supports the torso during locomotion, yet their inherent design has limited their functional growth to date. While many differing gait simulations have demonstrated stable solutions for lossless gait cycles, passive orthoses only diminish the user's impediment, and though powered gait exoskeletons can augment strength and endurance, they are limited by their energy demanding actuators. In response to these two extremes, an energy efficient locomotion assist device was developed from the basis of lossless gait models that did not require external power, and augmented locomotion by harvesting the inherent energy associated with the gait cycle. The simplest anthropomorphic leg can be modeled with a peg-leg shank, a knee, a thigh and a point mass for the head, arms and torso. Using a tuned non-linear hardening torsion spring at the knee joint, the torso support that is required between the ground and pelvis for lossless gait simulations can be generated; allowing the close physical realization of the theoretical. It was found that a single torsion spring can generate the leg thrusts necessary for a realistic range of walking and running gait velocities without the addition of any external power. While frictional losses do inhibit the locomotion assist device's efficiency, since the device functions in parallel with the user's leg, any losses can be supplemented with minimal muscular activity. These results give strong indication that a new avenue of gait assistive and gait augmenting devices that require minimal actuation energy is feasible.",

        "Abstrak": "Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is a delivery system for public works projects to design construct, manage and maintain public facilities by using private capital, management skills, and technical abilities. It was introduced in Japan about 10 years ago to encourage the stagnant Japanese economy and provide public services with higher quality and less cost to the country and the local authority. It has been applied to many public works projects, but not to large-scale infrastructure projects, such as toll road and airport projects. One of the main reasons for this is that specific methodologies of handling risks and uncertainties involved in long-term projects have not been introduced and demonstrated to either the public or the private sector. This thesis aims to help those involved in large-scale infrastructure development projects apply PFI to those projects by proposing a flexible methodology that will allow them to handle risks. Specifically, this thesis 1) proposes a quantitative methodology so that project managers can handle uncertainty in large-scale engineering projects, and 2) demonstrates how project managers can apply the proposed methodology practically to real-world projects, including how to model and evaluate projects, and demonstrates how the proposed methodology is useful for reducing risks and enhancing the value of projects. As a quantitative methodology, this thesis proposes real options analysis as a tool for considering uncertainty and incorporating flexibility into design, based on the premise that it is crucial not how accurately project managers forecast uncertainty but how they can handle it. This thesis also explains barriers to the implementation of the proposed concepts and methodology, and recommends how to alleviate them. The thesis uses two real-world case studies: the \"Tokyo International Airport New Runway Extension Project\" and the \"Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Project\".(cont.) Both show the process of modeling and analyzing projects and they demonstrate the benefits of the proposed concepts and methodologies, which can guide and encourage project managers to apply proposed concepts and methodology. The first case study applies a user-friendly methodology, which can alleviate the barriers to the implementation of the proposed concepts. The second case study illustrates that, by using their management skills, ingenuity, and originality, in PFI, project companies can not only reduce risks and enhance the value of projects but also contribute to the consumers' benefits and socioeconomics from the perspective of public policy, which realizes the idea of PFI.",

The motivation for the project is to establish an alternative cooking fuel that is less detrimental than existing options based on three criteria: health risks, environmental impact, and affordability. A method for improving the speed and safety of a critical process step is presented, and initial test findings demonstrate that the product generally matches the cooking parameters of the benchmark, the wood charcoal that this project seeks to replace. Second, the introduction of service learning pedagogy into three core mechanical engineering classes at MIT - 2.002 Mechanics and Materials II, 2.006 Thermo-Fluids Engineering II, and 2.009 Product Engineering Processes - is explored. Curricular materials, service projects, and assessment methods were developed and implemented. Based on initial research, the pedagogy is effective when integrated into the class well, meaning a project was chosen that was academically rigorous and matched both the curricular goals of the class and the needs of the community partner. In addition, positive social, career-oriented, and cognitive outcomes for students are evident, particularly for women and minority students. Use of service learning in 2.009 is also explored over four years, and positive results from interviews studying the interest in service learning by MIT mechanical engineering faculty are presented.",

        "Abstrak": "Delays and cost overruns are the rule rather than the exception in the construction industry. Design changes due to lack of constructability late in the construction phase generating costly ripple effect which create delay and disruption throughout the entire organization, are the largest contributors to the stated rule. In the building construction industry, of increased competitiveness, demand from many companies continued effort to develop new methods and tools, in which the design for quality, cost, construability and reliability play an important role. The planning and management of building design has historically focused upon traditional methods of planning such as Critical Path Method (CPM). Little effort is made to understand the complexities of the design process; instead design managers focus on allocating work packages where the planned output is a set of deliverables. This current design method forces design teams to manage their work on a discipline basis, each working on achieving their deliverable as dictated by the design program with little regard of the relationship with other disciplines and organizations. In addition, because Architect and Engineering firms view design and construction as two separate independent phases of work in project it makes it difficult to verify constructability in a design and create flow in the overall process. The goal of this study is to look at how aligning interests, objectives and practices based on lean fundamentals, during the earliest stages of a project, as a method of improving construction performance.",

        "Abstrak": "Accelerating diffusion of innovation to end users and enabling faster adoption is essential to product developers, especially in the industries having a rapid pace of innovation. The ability of innovators to engage with the user community to understand their needs, motivations and top issues is critical to developing products that hit the mark on meeting user needs. In the computing industry there is a need to evolve the innovation development process in parallel to the exponential growth in complexity of the products and the broad ecosystem support that is required to meet user expectations. There are many paths to engage a user community and to obtain end user insights to create a product vision and new usage models. A simple \"proof of concept\" framework extending product research and development to the end user community is articulated herein. This proof of concept framework is defined in the context of a platform - a collection of ingredients that work together to meet user need. Proof of concept is conducted with users prior to general availability of a product with early ingredients that are in the research and development pipeline. All business users of new product platforms do not adopt an innovation at the same time and can be qualitatively placed in widely accepted classification of adopter categories based on their receptivity to adopting a new product. The leading adopter categories in order are the innovator, early adopter and early majority. These categories of users may help shape current and future generations of a product specifically by validating usage scenarios with integration and deployment of a product under development in real user settings, and by helping to define trends and map requirements for future generations of platform capabilities. Using the proof of concept framework in this way helps ensure that when a product goes to market, it simply works and meets user expectations.The importance of recognizing a user need cannot be understated. The user feedback from the platform proof of concept stimulates research and development activities to address specific user needs in the current or future generations of a product platform. There are multiple communication channels for potential adopters of an innovation. Mass media channels are effective means to create awareness of an innovation. Proof of concepts with potential users enables more rapid eventual diffusion by translating user deployment and integration learning's into product characteristics that are broadly appealing to potential adopters.",

Based on the failure mode avoidance approach, the process and model allow the engineering teams to uncover and avoid potential tire/wheel and driveline NVH failure modes. Therefore, early in the product development process, development teams can identify control and noise factor limits and system level effects, avoid potential NVH failure modes, and develop appropriate countermeasures.Using insights from innovation diffusion theory, the process and tool were deployed systematically to NVH community, with user insights used to adapt and improve the process and tools.

The consumer electronics industry is changing dramatically in the areas of entertainment through audio and video playback, personal efficiency tools, and wireless communications. Equally as significant is the rapid development and feature migration that is occurring between four of the major mobile device categories; mobile phones, smart phones, PDA's, and media players. With this convergence occurring, automakers are finding it more difficult to satisfy the needs of consumers with respect to these new capabilities.In order for the automakers to establish a solution, a new framework needs to be established. The automakers are unable to satisfy this market desire through traditional technology delivery strategies, especially given the fast changing and complex interface that currently exists in this market space.This thesis establishes the framework used to identify and critically evaluate an external platform strategy for the purpose of satisfying the above need. The thesis draws upon leading literature to provide key attributes of successful external platform implementations. The first aspect of the framework established involves ensuring the need for an external platform through complexity and development clockspeed incompatibilities. The second section of the framework involves the evaluation of the architectural attributes that lead to external platform success. Finally, the stakeholders are identified and roles are established.The next phase of the analysis involves the evaluation of two prominent solution proposals using the established framework. These include the standards-based solution model that was developed at Automotive Multimedia Interface Collaboration (AMI-C), and the more recent commercial operating system proposal.(cont) These proposals are evaluated to determine if a specific proposal is better suited to capture the mobility market interface in the automobile than another. The analysis and framework provided it this thesis provides a basis for further tactical evaluation by the automakers that wish to meet the needs of the mobility market.",

As part of its drive to adopt lean manufacturing methodology in the plant and to stay competitive in the industry, TCG plans to effectively maximize its capital assets and reduce the warehouse space from 3500 to 1500 pallet spaces. This thesis focuses on the raw materials procurement and ordering methods in TCG. We study the accuracy of the demand forecasts for the finished products. And we investigate methods to improve procurement and inventory control. We use a 2-factor classification method to rank the 38 types of raw materials in the warehouse in terms of their importance based on their past procurement costs and the amount of warehouse space they occupied. We propose a just-in-time approach for the 9 most important items by having timely orders that match closely to the production schedule. A continuous review model is used for the next 11 items of less importance and a periodic review model is used for the remaining 18 items, which are of the least importance. We discuss and justify the assumptions used in our analysis. We provide a few further recommendations on how to improve inventory control based on observations of the current practices. The overall result shows that it might be possible to reduce the amount of space occupied by raw materials from the current average of 1076 pallets by 72%.",

Computational simulations were graphically used to understand the pressure and velocity distributions of the fluid-structure interactions of the three-linked swimmer, with slightly different movement, using an immersed boundary method computer program. Experiments using a mechanical prototype of a three-linked swimmer were conducted to validate and compare the numerical predictions derived from computational studies. Experimental results indicate that a flexible armed swimmer is more than three times as fast as its rigid armed counterpart. The analytical model presented in this study and the corresponding computational numerical simulations were found to capture the trends of the motion, and the predicted horizontal velocity came within 66% in value of the recorded experimental data.",

It consists of a separate module to meet each requirement; a module for heating, aligning, and applying force. The apparatus is capable of heating the MEMS device to over 400⁰C, applying more than 1000V across the device, applying greater than 4MPa of pressure, and aligning to within 0.5[micro]m in two directions to create an accurately aligned anodic bond.

        "Abstrak": "This thesis deals with two topics in lattice field theories. In the first part we discuss aspects of renormalization group flow and non-perturbative improvement of actions for scalar theories regularized on a lattice. We construct a perfect action, an action which is free of lattice artifacts, for a given theory. It is shown how a good approximation to the perfect action - referred to as classically perfect - can be constructed based on a well-defined blocking scheme for the 0(3) non-linear o-model. We study the O(N) non-linear r-model in the large-N limit and derive analytically its perfect action. This action is applied to the 0(3) model on a square lattice. The Wolff cluster algorithm is used to simulate numerically the system. We perform scaling tests and discuss the scaling properties of the large-N inspired perfect action as opposed to the standard and the classically perfect action. In the second part we present a new formulation for a quantum field theory with Abelian gauge symmetry. A Hamiltonian is constructed on a four-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice which is invariant under local transformations. The model is formulated as a 5-dimensional path integral of discrete variables. We argue that dimensional reduction will allow us to study the behavior of the standard compact U(1) gauge theory in 4-d. Based on the idea of the loop-cluster algorithm for quantum spins, we present the construction of a flux-cluster algorithm for the U(1) quantum link model for the spin-1/2 quantization of the electric flux. It is shown how improved estimators for Wilson loop expectation values can be defined. This is important because the Wilson loops are traditionally used to identify confining and Coulomb phases in gauge theories. Our study indicates that the spin-1/2 U(1) quantum link model is strongly coupled for all bare coupling values we examined.",

We then derive from first physical principles the dependence of Faraday rotation, absorption, and certain figures of merit on the material's dielectric tensor elements. Next, we use pulsed laser deposition to grow thin films of BiFeO3 on MgO (001) and SrTiO3 (001) substrates. After optimizing growth conditions to obtain high quality films, we characterize the films' crystal structure with two-dimensional x-ray diffraction. We then examine the magnetic, optical, and magneto-optical properties of these films. We find that the highly textured films grown on SrTiO3 are monoclinic with an out-of-plane c-axis aligned with the (001) direction of the substrate and approximate pseudocubic lattice parameters of a = b = 4.04 A, c = 3.95 A, and 90° - [beta] = -0.88°. These films are weakly magnetic, with a magnetization of 1.2 emu/cm3 at an applied field of 10 kOe; highly absorptive, with an average absorption coefficient of 910 cm-1; and possess a low specific Faraday rotation of 320/cm at 1.8 kOe of applied field. As expected, we find that the magneto-optical figure of merit is negligible for this material due to its high absorption, which we attribute to a thin surface layer of phase separated bismuth and iron oxides caused by bismuth segregation during growth. We offer additional explanations for these values and show the first results of newer, more promising work with mixed cation perovskite.",

First we generalize the rank of a partition [lambda] to the rank of a shifted partition S([lambda]).We show that the number of bars required in a minimal bar tableau of S([lambda]) is max(o, e + (â„“([lambda]) mod 2)), where o and e are the number of odd and even rows of [lambda]. As a consequence we show that the irreducible negative characters of [tilde]S[sub]n vanish on certain conjugacy classes. Another corollary is a lower bound on the degree of the terms in the expansion of Schur's Q[sub][lambda] symmetric functions in terms of the power sum symmetric functions. The second result gives a basis for the space spanned by the lowest degree terms in the expansion of the Schur symmetric functions in terms of the power sum symmetric functions. These lowest degree terms studied by Stanley correspond to minimal border strip tableaux of [lambda]. The Hilbert series of these spaces is the generating function giving the number of partitions of n into parts differing by at least 2. Applying the Rogers-Ramanujan identity, the generating function also counts the number of partitions of n into parts 5k + 1 and 5k - 1. Finally for each [lambda] we give a relation between the power sum symmetric functions and the monomial symmetric functions; the terms are indexed by the types of minimal border strip tableaux of [lambda].",

The goal of this thesis is to investigate the performance of one such model, the Hammerstein cascade, in describing isometric muscle force. We examine the effectiveness of Hammerstein models in predicting the isometric recruitment curve and dynamics of a muscle stimulated at fourteen frequencies between 1 to 100Hz. Explanted frog plantaris longus muscle is tested at the nominal isometric length only; hence, the muscle's force-length and force-velocity dependences are neither assumed nor ascertained. The pilot data are fitted using ten different models consisting of various combinations of linear dynamics with polynomial nonlinearities. Models identified using data with input stimulation frequencies of 20Hz and lower generate an average RMS error of 12% and are reliably stable (87 of 90 simulations). Between 25 to 40Hz, the average error generated by the estimated models is 10%, but the estimated dynamics are less stable (16 of 30 simulations). Above 40Hz, linear and Hammerstein nonlinear models fail to consistently generate stable dynamic estimates (11 of 30 simulations), and errors are large (eRMs = 44%).(cont.) Simulations also suggest Hammerstein models found iteratively do not perform much better than linear dynamic systems (in general, eRMS = 10 to 15%). In addition, simulations using iterated nonlinearities generate RMS errors that are comparable to those simulations using a fixed nonlinearity (both about 16%). These preliminary results warrant further investigation into the limits of Hammerstein models found iteratively in the identification of isometric muscle dynamics.",

With its enormous population of poor people, India is attracting increasing attention from commercial players and government agencies, both of which are instrumental to furthering the growth of microfinance. This study reviews the current state of microfinance in India using the case-study approach. Two examples were chosen as representatives of the most prevalent forms of microfinance delivery-the Grameen model and the Self Help Group model. The two cases also represent two diverse schools of thought that dominate the worldwide microfinance industry: for-profit commercial microfinance institutions (MFIs) and not-for-profit NGO MFIs. The study discusses evolving legal structures, strategies, financing models, and operating models used by Indian MFIs to rapidly grow their operations in order to fulfill the huge unmet demand. It also covers the legal, financial, and operational challenges facing MFIs, and concludes with recommendations for remedial measures and policy changes that are required to support the urgent need to expand microfinance services in India.",

        "Abstrak": "The experiments presented in this thesis use mutation analysis, and study of the cells of mice with a deletion allele for the Trp53 gene, to explore both the regulation of p53, and its downstream functions mediated by specific activation of target genes. Chapter 2 addresses the regulation of nuclear localization of the p53 protein. Previous reports in the literature had suggested that the p53 negative regulator HDM2 was a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that binds and carries p53 from the nucleus of the cell to the cytoplasm where it is destroyed by the proteasome. We determined that HDM2 with a mutated nuclear export sequence was still able to able to alter p53's cellular localization to a cytoplasmic pattern. The nuclear export sequence in the p53 C-terminus was required for this activity, as was the ability of HDM2 to ubiquitinate p53. Further studies indicated that ubiquitination of the p53 C-terminus was the basis for HDM2's ability to remove it from the nucleus and cause its efficient degradation. C-terminal ubiquitination causes the p53 nuclear export sequence to be activated or made more accessible to the nuclear export machinery of the cell. Chapter 3 summarizes cDNA microarray experiments in which Trp53-/- and Trp53+/+ fibroblasts were treated with a panel of genotoxic agents, and assayed for p53-dependent upregulation or downregulation of the approximately 15,000 gene sequences represented on the microarray. New candidate p53 target genes were revealed, among them the DNA repair gene ErccS, which encodes the xeroderma pigmentosum disease gene homolog Xpg, a participant in nucleotide excision repair and a mediator of base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage.(cont.) Further analysis of most of the DNA repair genes in the mouse genome using real-time PCR indicated that a second gene, Polk, encoding the translesion DNA polymerase kappa, is also a p53-induced gene. Chapter 4 describes further characterizes the p53-dependent regulation of Ercc5, and shows that it is a directly-regulated p53 target gene with a p53-responsive site in its first intron. TrpS3-null cells show a modest reduction in the ability to repair an oxidatively-damaged DNA construct, and this defect is rescued by exogenous expression of retrovirally transduced XPG, indicating that the lower levels of this gene are likely responsible for the defect.",

I offer it as an informal introduction to some work I've been doing over the last year on common sense reasoning. Four themes wander in and out.\r\n1) Computation provides an observation vocabulary for introspection. With a little work, you can learn to exhume your models of everyday activities. This method can provide empirical grounding for computational theories of the central systems of mind.\r\n2) The central systems of mind arise in each of us as a rational response to the impediments to living posed by the laws of computation. One of these laws is that all search problems (theorem proving for example) are intractable. Another is that no one model of anything is good enough for all tasks. Reasoning from these laws can provide theoretical grounding for computational theories of the central systems of mind.\r\n3) Mental models tend to form mathematical lattices under the relation variously called subsumption or generalization. Your mind puts a lot of effort into maintaining this lattice because it has so many important properties. One of these is that the more abstract models provide a normalized decomposition of world-situations that greatly constrains the search for useful analogies.\r\n4) I have been using these ideas in building a computational theory of routines, the frequency repeated and phenomenologically automatic rituals of which most of daily life is made.

It is essentially a new approach to finding modularities in real-time control systems in which module boundaries are sought not between separate information processing functions, but between separate task-achieving units. Task achieving units for complex behaviors are created by merging together the task-achieving units from simpler component behaviors into societies with competing and cooperating parts. This paper surveys the areas of agreement and disagreement in four approaches to programming with societies of behaviors. By analyzing where the systems differ, both on what constitutes a task-achieving unit and on how to merge such units together, this paper hopes to lay the groundwork for future work on controlling robust mobile robots using this approach.",

Any particular planner is simply an abstraction barrier. Below that level we get a choice of whether to slot in another planner or to place a program which does the right thing. Why stop there?

In order to overcome the lack of positional cloning resources available in the rat to clone the Lyp gene, we developed and successfully implemented a conservation-of-linkage (COL) cloning strategy. Using the COL between the rat Lyp region and its murine counterpart, we developed large-scale YAC and fine-scale P1/BAC physical maps of the mouse Lyp region, and integrated these maps with a fine-scale genetic map of the rat Lyp region. Using cDNA fragments obtained through direct cDNA selection, we established a transcript map of the mouse Lyp region. One of these transcripts, PA, maps in the region fully-linked with Lyp and its transcript level is severely reduced in Lyp/LLyp homozygous animals. It is expressed chiefly in immune system organs, most strongly in the thymus, where Lyp is thought to act; within the thymus, PA is restricted to punctate expression in the thymic medulla--again, the inferred site of Lyp action in late T-cell thymic maturation. Although no functional mutation has yet been identified in the Lyp haplotype allele of PA, it remains the leading candidate gene for Lyp. The successful cloning of the rat Lyp region validates the COL cloning strategy and suggests that this strategy may be widely applicable among mammalian species.",

The automated program recognition system can use this algorithm to help make a more efficient flow graph parser. The process of automated program recognition involves recognizing familiar data structures and algorithmic fragments (called clichés) in a program so that a hierarchical description of the program can be constructed. The recognition is done by representing the program as a flow graph and parsing it with a graph grammar which encodes the clichés. In order to find clichés in the midst of unfamiliar code, it is necessary to run the parser on all possible subgraphs of the graph, thus starting the parser an exponential number of times. This is too inefficient for practical use on large programs, so this algorithm has been implemented to allow the matchings to be performed in polynomial time.",

The large-scale organization of the memory is based on structures called a bypassable causal selection networks.

After payment of dividends, all excess cash is disgorged via stock repurchases that elicit no price reactions. The theoretical model generates results consistent with many stylized facts related to dividend initiations, including: a positive announcement effect associated with a dividend initiation; a larger (in absolute value) negative announcement effect for a dividend cut/omission than for an initiation; and a probability of dividend initiation that is increasing in the firm's profitability and assets in place, and decreasing in the personal tax rate on dividends relative to capital gains. The model also generates additional novel predictions, one of which is that the probability of dividend initiation is decreasing in managerial ownership of the firm, and this effect is stronger the weaker is (external) corporate governance. A second novel prediction is that the dividend initiation probability is decreasing in the potential loss in value from the \"two-audience-signaling\" information disclosure costs associated with secondary equity issues. These new predictions are tested empirically using a predictive logit model of dividend initiations. Moreover, the paper tests and finds additional empirical support for the information-disclosure result using a regression discontinuity design.",

One tool to address sustainability in industrial activities is Industrial Symbiosis, which is the study of cooperation across industry boundaries to increase sustainability. Past efforts to generate these relationships have struggled. Central to these failures is the difficulty of identifying and motivating stakeholders. This thesis proposes a new approach to analysis that directly addresses these failures. The approach analyzes an entire domestic industry for attractive opportunities to cooperate. By making the profit of stakeholders the primary criteria for investigation, this approach identifies opportunities where existing incentives to cooperate are greatest. This research demonstrates the new approach in a case study of brick manufacturing in the United States. Through the use of life cycle assessment, geographic information systems, and decision analysis, this thesis identifies the brick manufacturing facilities that are most likely to gain substantial economic benefit from the use of processed glass cullet as a fluxing agent. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that these economic benefits are connected to environmental benefit. The results of this case study indicate that the approach is not only feasible, but if it is transferable to other industries, it taps into a substantial competitive advantage for data rich manufacturing sectors like those in the United States. These economic benefits will also lead to increased environmental sustainability.",

        "Abstrak": "Quantifying the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres. We examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal atmospheres with adiabatic index γ=5/3) that the local atmospheric mass loss fraction for ground velocities v[subscript g]≲0.25[subscript vesc] is given by χ[subscript loss]=(1.71v[subscript g]/v[subscript esc])[superscript 4.9], where v[subscript esc] is the escape velocity from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of the impactor velocity v[subscript Imp] and mass m[subscript Imp] and given by X[subscript loss]≃0.4x+1.4x[superscript 2]-0.8x[superscript 3] (isothermal atmosphere) and X[subscript loss]≃0.4x+1.8x[superscript 2]-1.2x[superscript 3] (adiabatic atmosphere), where x=(v[subscript Imp]m/v[subscript esc]M). Atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: (1) large enough impactors the m ≳ √2ρ[subscript 0](πhR)[superscript 3/2] source (25 km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, which is h/2R of the whole atmosphere, where h, R and and ρ[subscript 0] are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. (2) Smaller impactors, but above m>4πρ[subscript 0]h[superscript 3] (1 km for the current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit (2 km for the current Earth). For impactor flux size distributions parametrized by a single power law, N(>r)∝r[superscript -q+1], with differential power law index q  , we find that for 1<q<3 the atmospheric mass loss proceeds in regime (1) whereas for q>3 the mass loss is dominated by regime (2). Impactors with m≲4πρ[subscript 0]h[superscript 3] are not able to eject any atmosphere. Despite being bombarded by the same planetesimal population, we find that the current differences in Earth’s and Venus’ atmospheric masses can be explained by modest differences in their initial atmospheric masses and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimal impacts. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets.",

        "Abstrak": "The main objective of the research presented in this thesis is to improve our understanding for the evolution of the upper mantle beneath East Asia and the Tibetan Plateau through high resolution P-wave tomography. The approach to high resolution tomography is based on (i) the combined use of a large range of different types of seismic data, (ii) the use of approximate finite frequency sensitivity kernels to account for difference in measurement technique and frequency content of the data, (iii) the use of an irregular grid with cell-size adapted to sampling density, and (iv) the use of a priori information, e.g., on crustal structure from receiver function analysis. I construct a multi-scale and high resolution seismic tomography model of the upper mantle structure beneath East Asia and the Tibetan Plateau. The new model reveals that the mantle structure associated with the Indian subduction varies considerably along the strike of the collision zone. From west to east, the dip angle of Indian subduction increases and the distance over which the plate underthrusts the Tibetan Plateau decreases. Oblique subduction and changes of dip angle in the central part of the collision zone may cause and determine the location of the north-south trending normal faults in central Tibet. The eastward retreating slabs of western Pacific and Philippine plates are deflected in the transition zone beneath the Korea, Japan Sea, and East China. Some of Mesozoic subducted slabs have reached as far west as 1100E longitude under the Yangtze Craton, which might have resulted from the Eocene subduction at the South China and Japan trenches.(cont.) Precambrian continental roots under Ordos block and Sichuan Basin, which extend to 250-300 km depth, may form a boundary of transition in tectonic regimes from the India-Eurasia collision control in the southwest to Pacific, Philippine Sea, and Java-Sumatra subductions control in the east and southeast. I conclude that the (direct) influence of the India-Eurasia collision on the tectonic evolution of East Asia may be confined to the Tibetan plateau and vicinity, whereas the tectonic development of a large area east and southeast of Ordos, Sichuan and Burma is driven by the stress field and 3-D upper mantle processes associated with subductions of Pacific, Philippine Sea, and Indo-Australia plates.",

Methods for manufacturing glass sheets and further sheet shaping processes are covered. Future generation, high resolution x-ray telescopes require thin optics with large surface area to thickness ratio and a surface flatness of -500 nm. A novel method utilizing porous ceramics, which provide a thin layer of air for sheet glass to rest on during the shaping process, is investigated. The shaping process involves slumping glass on a uniform layer of air at elevated temperatures, where the viscosity of glass is low enough for it to sag under its own weight and replicate the surface it rests on. Flow in porous, rectangular air bearings is covered with both flat and grooved surfaces. The pressure distribution in the air gap between the ceramic and the glass sheet determines the surface quality of glass during slumping. The mechanical integrity of porous ceramics at elevated temperatures is investigated to predict the effect of the decrease in ceramic stiffness on the final shape of the optic.(cont.) A metrology truss used to kinematically constrain thin optics during metrology is designed. This device mitigates the effects of external forces, such as gravity, friction, and thermal stresses, induced on the optic while being mechanically constrained, thus significantly improving the repeatability of the optic surface map measurements.",

Oregon’s 2008 expansion of Medicaid through random-lottery selection of potential enrollees from a waiting list offers the opportunity to assess Medicaid’s effects with a randomized evaluation that is not contaminated by such confounding factors. In a previous examination of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, we found that Medicaid coverage increased health care use across a range of settings, improved financial security, and reduced rates of depression among enrollees, but it produced no detectable changes in several measures of physical health, employment rates, or earnings.",

        "Abstrak": "Since the first application of computer programs to problem solving in the 1960s, computers and computational processes have been gradually introduced in the field of architecture to the point where today they are an inherent part of architectural practice and education. This extensive use of computers in architecture, however, occurs late in the design phase, at the stage of production of construction documents or representation of the final product, and so rarely are computers used to address the early design phase, that of creativity. A significant reason for this is that computational processes, based on algorithms, use explicit rules and unambiguous procedures, while the processes that architects employ at the early design phase are implicit and obscure. Whether a process is implicit or explicit, though, it is still underlined by a framework of interacting rules. Can rules, therefore, provide a bridge between explicit and implicit processes? The present research addresses this question through a design experiment with a group of professional architects. The experiment was in design composition from scratch and the scope was to identify the role of rules in the architects' design processes. In this framework a shape grammar formalism was developed to describe both the design activities and the end products. Architects were found to work towards a design solution by developing general rule schemas that gradually take the form of specific and explicit rules. It was also observed that this process is constantly informed and enhanced by the emergence of perceptual design events.",

        "Abstrak": "Historically the pharmaceutical industry has been highly profitable. However, the increasing regulatory requirements, bargaining power of buyers, and drug failures together with the threat of biosimilars and decreasing R&D productivity are creating challenges for research driven pharmaceutical companies. With future revenue growth uncertain, pharmaceutical companies must focus on cost reduction to sustain the profit margins needed to support research and development of new medicines. The lean methodology first developed by Toyota is recommended as a way to achieve operational success. A deep analysis of the current state of the pharmaceutical industry and the operational inefficiencies inherent in regulated drug production is provided. The renewed importance of operations within the pharmaceutical business model is explored through a case study of the biotechnology segment's leader, Amgen. Specifically, the design and initial rollout of the Amgen Process Excellence (APEX) initiative is studied. The APEX methodology is a six step process based on lean and six-sigma principles to guide operational improvement activities at Amgen. During the author's internship at the Rhode Island site the rollout of the APEX movement included a current state analysis of the site's financial and operational performance. As a result of this analysis, a prioritized list of improvement ideas was generated and incorporated into a future state vision for the site. Implementation of these improvement ideas is estimated to result in a reduction in cycle time by 55%, lower inventory levels, and the elimination of millions of dollars in waste. The following major conclusions were developed as a result of this work.(cont.) First, substantial improvement opportunities exist within current pharmaceutical manufacturing. Second, pharmaceutical companies must build operational efficiencies into manufacturing process design. Lastly, operational excellence cannot simply be attained through the implementation of an improvement toolkit.",

Half the drinking water for the camp is provided by thirteen springs. The volume and turbidity of these springs varies annually, correlating with the rainy and dry seasons. Treating the varying turbidity and volume at these sources so that the water can be effectively disinfected is the treatment goal. Available materials and operation and maintenance capabilities are also design parameters. Horizontal-flow roughing filtration was determined to fit these parameters and a design with two equivalent filters operating in parallel is recommended. One important feature of the filters is baffles that dictate the flow path of water through the filter. A second feature is an outflow at the top of the filter that will maintain a constant water volume in the filter. The feasibility of the design is based on flow tests and turbidity measurements taken on site as well as weekly flow rates and turbidities for 2007 provided by AMI. The requirements for mechanical regeneration of the filter are also determined.",

How does a company take advantage of the benefits of global operations while still taking into account the corporate strategy and risks associated with a location?

This thesis combines analytical hierarchy process with a two level decision matrix to quantify the score of each location. A risk profile was developed to quantify the risk associated with specific locations and criteria in order to provide a more complete picture of the potential costs and benefits of building a facility in a certain location. This more complete view of location analysis will provide a tool that is both repeatable and reliable in its results and allows for an objective decision to be made on location in terms of the critical factors.",

        "Abstrak": "B cell development consists of an ordered program of rearrangement and transcriptional events, leading ultimately to the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules. This process involves the interaction of cis acting elements with trans acting factors. The octamer element (5'ATGCAAAT-3') is conserved in Ig promoters and enhancers and is thought to be important in transcriptional regulation. To date, only two octamer-binding proteins have been identified in B cells, the ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 and the lymphoid restricted Oct-2. While biochemical evidence suggests that Oct-i and Oct-2 exhibit identical DNA binding specificity, their respective roles in vivo have not been clearly defined. B cell development proceeds normally in mice deficient for Oct-2 and the B cell specific coactivator OCA-B/OBF-1/Bob-1 but these experiments were complicated by the presence of Oct-1 in the cells. In order to understand the degree of functional redundancy shared by homologous members of this family, a genetic model of Oct-i was created using gene targeting. The targeting strategy replaced exon 3, which encodes part of the transactivation domain, with a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette in the antisense transcriptional orientation. Any potential transcript derived from the targeted allele would harbor frameshift mutations, resulting in the deletion of the DNA binding POU domain. These animals are embryonic lethal with erythropoietic defects of variable penetrance due to a selective reduction of β-globin expression. Cells derived from these embryos show a 40-fold decrease in protein activity and 30-fold decrease in total detectable Oct-i polypeptides as well as a complete lack of octamer-dependent promoter activity in vivo.(cont.) Furthermore, replication of herpes simplex virus is impaired in Oct-i deficient cells. Surprisingly, functional lymphocytes with surface IgM expression comparable to wildtype cells can be generated from E13.5 Oct-i deficient embryos by adoptive transfer, albeit at slightly reduced numbers. When Oct-1 +/- animals were crossed with Oct-2 +/- animals, the transheterozygous offsprings were recovered at a decreased Mendelian frequency, suggesting a cooperative role for these two proteins in mediating survival.",

The rationale for this study is to test the hypothesis that the HealthMap informatics tools can complement epidemiological data captured by traditional surveillance monitoring systems for meningitis due to Neisseria meningitides (N. meningitides) by highlighting severe transmissible disease activity and outbreaks in the United States.\r\nMethods\r\nAnnual analyses of N. meningitides disease alerts captured by HealthMap were compared to epidemiological data captured by the Centers for Disease Control’s Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) for N. meningitides. Morbidity and mortality case reports were measured annually from 2010 to 2013 (HealthMap) and 2005 to 2012 (ABCs).\r\nFindings\r\nHealthMap N. meningitides monitoring captured 80-90% of alerts as diagnosed N. meningitides, 5-20% of alerts as suspected cases, and 5-10% of alerts as related news articles. HealthMap disease alert activity for emerging disease threats related to N. meningitides were in agreement with patterns identified historically using traditional surveillance systems. HealthMap’s strength lies in its ability to provide a cumulative “snapshot” of weak signals that allows for rapid dissemination of knowledge and earlier public awareness of potential outbreak status while formal testing and confirmation for specific serotypes is ongoing by public health authorities.\r\nConclusions\r\nThe underreporting of disease cases in internet-based data streaming makes inadequate any comparison to epidemiological trends illustrated by the more comprehensive ABCs network published by the Centers for Disease Control. However, the expected delays in compiling confirmatory reports by traditional surveillance systems (at the time of writing, ABCs data for 2013 is listed as being provisional) emphasize the helpfulness of real-time internet-based data streaming to quickly fill gaps including the visualization of modes of disease transmission in outbreaks for better resource and action planning. HealthMap can also contribute as an internet-based monitoring system to provide real-time channel for patients to report intervention-related failures.",

The sensor consists of layers of thin-film copper and PDMS, and the model can be used to determine the effects on sensor sensitivity and durability of variations in material properties and geometry. The model was used to study the effect of variations in copper thickness. Four copper thicknesses, 0.3[mu]m, 0.5[mu]m, 3[mu]m, and 9[mu]m, were analyzed under a range of pressure loads. The thickness of the copper affected both the stress in the material and the displacement of the copper when a pressure load was applied to the sensor model. The stress in the sensor was highest for 3[mu]m copper, potentially causing decreased durability in this sensor. The separation between the copper strips beneath the pressure load was highest for 9[mu]m copper, so this sensor may have lower accuracy for small loads. Thin copper strips are challenging to manufacture, so the largest but most accurate and durable copper strip thickness, 0.5[mu]m, is recommended from this analysis.",

In a startup company environment, fire fighting oftentimes becomes the norm rather than the exception despite the best efforts to eliminate it. In particular, there are frequently constrained resources, and project managers face tough allocation decisions that can lead to a fire fighting culture. This thesis develops a system dynamics model to simulate the resource allocation decisions a group of Project Managers at a startup company must face. A current state simulation is presented with a discussion of current practices, and several future alternative scenarios are tested and analyzed. Results show that current practices allow for on-time completion of projects within reasonable work hours. Hiring of additional employees may be able to reduce the gross number of hours employees work, and workforce expansion is compared versus increased project workload to identify acceptable and sustainable levels of growth. Productivity gains in the form of increased computational speed were found to be as effective as hiring new employees, and developing in-house manufacturing capabilities may be viable depending on cost and flexibility. Unexpectedly, fire fighting behavior in the system dynamics model was observed to be minimal, and the flexibility inherent in the startup environment was a major contributor to minimizing fire fighting that did occur.",

In Essay 1, I develop a novel explanation for the well-known endowment effect - the tendency for owners to value goods more than non-owners do. According to a prominent explanation for this effect, the prospect of losing possessions creates psychological pain, inducing sellers to demand more than buyers will pay. My alternative account is based on transaction disutility: consumers are reluctant to trade on terms that are disadvantageous with respect to perceived market prices. The endowment effect appears to be caused by inflated selling prices because market prices usually exceed the value of ownership to consumers. But I show that reducing reference prices relieves sellers' transaction disutility, shrinking or eliminating the effect. Moreover, very low reference prices create disutility among buyers, resulting in disparities driven by a reluctance to buy, not to sell. Essay 2 explores the implications of transaction disutility for consumer preferences. Maximum buying and minimum selling prices are commonly believed to reveal preferences: a consumer who prefers one good over another presumably has a higher reservation price for it. But transaction disutility can distort reservation prices away from underlying values. If alternative measures of preference - such as binary choices between goods - are not regarded by consumers as transactions, they are not subject to such distortions. This difference can create preference reversals, that is, incoherence between explicit choices and the preferences implied by stated reservation prices. I find strong experimental evidence for this proposition. The \"Bayesian Truth Serum\" (BTS) is a survey scoring method designed to provide truth telling incentives for respondents answering multiple choice questions about intrinsically private matters: opinions, tastes, past behavior.(cont.) My final essay discusses several tests of BTS. In one questionnaire, respondents indicated their familiarity with various items (e.g. electronics brands), one-third of which were nonexistent foils. BTS did in fact reward truth telling: the scoring method severely penalized \"recognition\" of foils. Also, survey takers viewed the BTS method as credible: people who were paid for achieving higher BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils, even when facing competing incentives to deceive.",

        "Abstrak": "There is much enthusiastic debate on the topic of generation gaps in the workplace today; what the generational differences are, how to address the apparent challenges, and if the generations themselves are even real. Despite the frenzy, however, there has been relatively limited empirical research performed on this issue; in particular, no empirical research in the context of an engineering organization seems to have been performed. With that in mind, the main intent of the thesis is to determine the existence of generational differences among engineers in a large, technical organization, and discuss the potential implications of the findings. Extensive literature research and analysis identified communication techniques, leadership preferences, learning styles, and work motivation to be the key hypothesized differences most pertinent to an engineering organization. A questionnaire was put together based on these differences and distributed to a sample that consisted of approximately eighty members from each of the four generations: Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, Millennials. In general, data analysis revealed that engineers do not exhibit generation gaps to the same extent as described in the literature. In fact, much of the data suggested contrary views, most notable of which was the importance of face-to-face communication, especially amongst the younger engineers. Knowledge transfer across generations remains a challenge, however, and possible approaches to addressing this issue are through physical accommodations, extensive mentorship programs, and salient investments in Information Technology (IT).",

This thesis compares two predominant approaches in the quantified modeling of technological innovation and competition. Multi-mode framework, based on the Lotka-Volterra equation barrowed from biological ecology, provide a rich setting for assessing the interaction between two or more technologies. A more recent approach uses System Dynamics to model the dynamics of innovative industries. A System Dynamics approach enables the development of very comprehensive models, which can cover multiple dimensions of innovation, and provides very broad insights for innovative and competitive landscape of an industry. As well as comparing these theories in detail, a case study is also performed on both of them. The phenomenal competition between two technologies in the consumer photography market; the recent battle between digital and film camera technology, is used as a test case and simulated by both models. Real market data is used as inputs to the simulations. Outputs are compared and interpreted with the realities of the current market conditions and predictions of industry analysts. Conclusions are derived on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. Directions for future research on model extensions incorporating other forms of innovation are given, such as collaborative interaction in SME networks.",

We have studied a set of genetically-interacting genes, sup-9, sup-10 and unc-93, whose products are predicted to form a protein complex that when misregulated leads to severe muscle paralysis in the nematode C. elegans. We cloned sup-9 and found it encodes a K+ channel of the recently discovered mammalian two-pore family of voltage-insensitive leak channels, suggesting that SUP-10 and UNC-93, along with multiple UNC-93-like genes in Drosophila and humans, are the first regulatory subunits for two-pore K+ channels. Based on pharmacological data, we propose that gain-of-function mutations in the sup-9 channelor in its proposed subunits result in muscle paralysis through excessive K+ efflux and hyperpolarization of muscle cells. We cloned sup-18, a regulator of the channel complex, and show that SUP-18 is a type-three transmembrane protein that colocalizes with SUP-9 in muscle membranes and whose intracellular domain is similar to bacterial NADH nitroreductases that use an FMN cofactor. We identified a mutation in a predicted FMN-binding residue of SUP-18 that both eliminates its in vivo function without disrupting its membrane localization and that impairs the enzymatic activity of a related Thermophilus enzyme, suggesting that SUP-18 may couple cell metabolism with membrane excitability.(cont.) Through genetic and molecular studies, we determined that the SUP-10 subunit acts together with SUP-18 to activate the SUP-9 channel through a novel conserved domain in SUP-9. This domain is not required for the activation of SUP-9 by UNC-93, thus defining two independent modes of activation for a two-pore channel by multiple subunits. We also discovered a second domain in SUP-9, conserved in the human TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels, that integrates multiple regulatory inputs. Finally, our analysis of the subcellular localization of other C. elegans two-pore channels suggests that they can be differentially targeted within the cell membrane of muscle cells.",

This thesis investigates factors influencing the catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules by the HCMV glycoproteins US2 and US 11 and the degradation of the model substrate TCRuc. The ER chaperone calnexin, implicated in glycoprotein folding, and the ER chaperones protein disulfide isomerase and Erolu, implicated in substrate disulfide bond formation, were examined for their roles in protein dislocation. By targeting these ER chaperones with siRNA constructs, the cellular levels of these ER chaperones were significantly reduced. Nevertheless, the rates of degradation of TCRct and the US2- and US 11-catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules were similar to wild-type cells. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) transcriptionally regulates ER chaperones and is essential in S. cerevisiae for efficient degradation of model ER substrates. In mammalian cells, neither the ATF6-dependent response nor the IREltc-XBP-1-dependent response of the UPR was found to be essential for efficient degradation of TCRc, US2-, or US 11-catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules. Interestingly, the ATF6 response, but not the IRElct-XBP-1 response, is essential for cellular viability. To better define the substrate requirements of US2 and US 11, the 30 residue cytoplasmic tail of MHC class I molecules was mutated. US2 can degrade MHC class I molecules with a cytoplasmic tail shortened to 10 residues or lengthened, by the fusion of GFP to the C-terminus, to several hundred residues.(cont.) In contrast, US 11 only degrades MHC class I molecules possessing a cytoplasmic tail of 30 amino acids. These data support a model that US2 and US 11 act through distinct degradative mechanisms. To define modular functional domains of US2 and US 11, lumenal or cytoplasmic domains were reciprocally exchanged between the viral molecules and between each viral molecule and their degradation substrate, the HLA-A2 heavy chain. Most chimeric molecules were not targeted for degradation when expressed alone or with their complementary construct. However, the US 11 molecule in which the cytoplasmic tail was exchanged for that of HLA-A2 was rapidly dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. In addition, lumenal GFP possessing the transmembrane domain of US 11 and the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-A2 was rapidly dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. Mutation of the critical glutamine residue in the transmembrane domain of US 11 essential for destruction of MHC class I molecules resulted in a marked stabilization of the GFP construct.",

        "Abstrak": "The pocket protein family is comprised of pRB (the protein product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene), p107, and p130. This family regulates the GI/S transition by interacting with their major downstream target, the E2F transcription factor. E2F is a heterodimeric protein composed of one DP subunit and one E2F subunit. The E2F family can be subdivided into three categories based upon structural and functional homology: E2F6; the 'activating E2Fs' (1-3); and 'the repressive E2Fs' (4-5). The focus of this study is E2F4 and E2F5, the members of the repressive E2F subgroup. The repressive E2Fs function by occupying E2F responsive promoters during Go and recruiting in the pocket proteins. As cells begin cycling, E2F4 and E2F5 are replaced at promoters by members of the activating E2Fs subgroup. Loss of either E2F4 or E2F5 does not result in cell cycle defects but instead lead to the abnormal development of specific tissues. The lack of a cell cycle phenotype in single mutants could be due to compensation by the other repressive E2F. In order to determine the role that E2F4·pocket protein repressive complexes play in regulating cell cycle control, differentiation, and development, mice lacking E2F4 and two members of the pocket protein family, p107 and p130, were generated. Analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from mutant embryos revealed that while loss of E2F4 alone did not lead to defects in cell cycle control, it did significantly enhance the ability of cells to differentiate into adipocytes. This phenotype could be further enhanced by additional loss of p107 and p130. Analysis of mice lacking E2F4, p107, and p130 revealed a requirement for these proteins in regulating fetal hematpoiesis. Taken together, these data suggest that E2F·pocket protein repressive complexes are critical regulators of differentiation and development.",

An elegant model for shallow binding in LISP 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment structure transformation called \"re-rooting\". Re-rooting is completely general and reversible, and is optional in the sense that a LISP 1.5 interpreter will operate correctly whether or not re-rooting is invoked on every context change. Since re-rooting leaves (ASSOC X A) invariant, for all variables X and all environments A, the programmer can have access to a re-rooting primitive, (SHALLOW), which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and which effects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics. So long as re-rooting is an indivisible operation, multiple processes can be active in the same environment structure. The re-rooting scheme is compared to a cache scheme for shallow binding and the two are found to be compatible. Finally, the concept of re-rooting is shown not to depend upon LISP's choice of dynamic instead of lexical binding for free variables; hence it can be used in an Algol interpreter, for example.",

Given few timing constraints, it computes a warp that both satisfies these constraints and maximizes local timing similarities to the reference. The algorithm is fast enough to incorporate into standard animation workflows. We apply the technique to two common tasks: preserving the natural timing of motions under new time constraints and modifying the timing of motions for stylistic effects.",

        "Abstrak": "Self-assembling micron-scale structures based on standard photolithographic and thin film deposition techniques are investigated. Differences in residual stress between successive thin film layers causes the structures to roll up when an underlying sacrificial layer is removed. The primary structure of interest was a swiss-roll structure comprised of alternating layers of metal and insulator so that the self-assembled system forms an RCL electrical circuit with a well-defined resonant frequency. So-called nanoscroll structures, comprised of two swiss-rolls attached at a common end, were the most commonly observed fabrication result and are expected to have electrical properties very similar to swiss rolls. It has been predicted that such electrical properties lead to, a negative effective magnetic permeability for a narrow frequency band, potentially in the far infrared region. These structures thus can contribute a vital component ([mu]eff < 0) necessary for developing a LHM (left-handed material). Many successful materials combinations have been demonstrated. The layers in the recommended system are (from the bottom up) silicon dioxide, chrome, gold, and chrome. The smallest rollup diameter was achieved for a system of nickel on silicon dioxide and was measured to be 2 [mu]m. Processing conditions such as film thickness and releasing etchant were also optimized. The mechanical behavior of the films was modeled using standard beam theory modified for application to thin films and predicted stresses that are comparable to those found in literature. Other applications for these rollup structures were considered, including a high-speed switching polarizer. Fold-up structures that self-assemble into origami-like shapes due(cont.) to the same basic principles were also fabricated, though an application for them was not identified.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis we give a probabilistic proof of the Morse inequalities in the nondegenerate and degenerate case. For the nondegenerate case the kernel associated with the Witten Laplacian has an expression via the Malliavin calculus. The first step is the analysis of this heat kernel at a point away the critical set. Using Markov property, an iteration procedure and estimates on exit times from balls, everything is reduced to the estimation of a solution to a parabolic initial-boundary problem on a ball in the Euclidean space. We achieve that by constructing a supersolution. For the case the point is close to the critical set, we use an integration by parts in the Malliavin calculus and split the analysis for paths staying inside a given distance from the critical point or exiting the corresponding ball. For the paths exiting, again an iterative Markov property argument reduces the problem to a parabolic initial-boundary value problem that can be handled by the construction of the supersolution mentioned above. For the quantity involving the paths staying inside a given ball around the critical point, we can reverse the argument, this time with the Euclidean space playing the role of the original manifold and reduce the problem to one in the Euclidean settings. This turns out to be an elementary harmonic oscillator problem that finishes the argument.(cont.) The case of the degenerate Bott-Morse function requires a bit more work due to the fact that the geometry near the critical submanifolds is in general not trivial. After some standard constructions, we have two choices of the connection around critical submanifolds. One is the Levi-Civita and the other is Bismut's connection. The main step in this analysis is to prove that the heat kernels of certain operators with respect to Levi-Civita connection and the Bismut connection stay bounded when the parameters involved become large. This is achieved by a fiberwise version of the argument given in the nondegenerate case. Using the boundedness, one can prove the basic comparison. Finally, the rest is just a fiberwise harmonic oscillator problem.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis examines several aspects of reduced decompositions in finite Coxeter groups. Effort is primarily concentrated on the symmetric group, although some discussions are subsequently expanded to finite Coxeter groups of types B and D. In the symmetric group, the combined frameworks of permutation patterns and reduced decompositions are used to prove a new characterization of vexillary permutations. This characterization and the methods used yield a variety of new results about the structure of several objects relating to a permutation. These include its commutation classes, the corresponding graph of the classes, the zonotopal tilings of a particular polygon, and a poset defined in terms of these tilings. The class of freely braided permutations behaves particularly well, and its graphs and posets are explicitly determined. The Bruhat order for the symmetric group is examined, and the permutations with boolean principal order ideals are completely characterized. These form an order ideal which is a simplicial poset, and its rank generating function is computed. Moreover, it is determined when the set of permutations avoiding a particular set of patterns is an order ideal, and the rank generating functions of these ideals are computed.(cont.) The structure of the intervals and order ideals in this poset is elucidated via patterns, including progress towards understanding the relationship between pattern containment and subintervals in principal order ideals. The final discussions of the thesis are on reduced decompositions in the finite Coxeter groups of types B and D. Reduced decompositions of the longest element in the hyperoctahedral group are studied, and expected values are calculated, expanding on previous work for the symmetric group. These expected values give a quantitative interpretation of the effects of the Coxeter relations on reduced decompositions of the longest element in this group. Finally, the Bruhat order in types B and D is studied, and the elements in these groups with boolean principal order ideals are characterized and enumerated by length.",

        "Abstrak": "(cont.) In the case of a classical linear sea-level rise of one meter per century, the use of DIVA generally decreases the protection fraction of the coastline, and results in a smaller protection cost because of high spatial concentration of capital. As in past studies, wetland loss continues to be dominant for most regions, and the total cost does not decline appreciably where wetland loss remains about the same. The total cost for the United States is about $320 billion (in 1995 U.S. dollars), an estimate comparable with other studies. Nevertheless, capital loss and protection cost may not be negligible for developing countries, in light of their small gross domestic product. Using realistic sea-level rise scenarios based on the Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) simulations substantially reduce the cost of sea-level rise for two reasons: a smaller rise of sea level in 2100 and a nonlinear form of the path of sea-level rise. As in many of the past studies, the thesis employs conventional but rather unrealistic assumptions: perfect information about future sea-level rise and neglect of the stochastic nature of storm surges. The author suggests that future work should tackle uncertain and stochastic sea-level rise damages.To improve the estimate of economic costs of future sea-level rise associated with global climate change, the thesis generalizes the sea-level rise cost function originally proposed by Fankhauser, and applies it to a new database on coastal vulnerability, Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA). With the new cost function, a new estimate of the cost present values over the 21st century is produced. An analytic expression for the generalized sea-level rise cost function is obtained to explore the effect of various spatial distributions of capital and nonlinear sea-level rise scenarios. With its high spatial resolution, DIVA shows that capital is usually highly spatially concentrated along a nation's coastline, and that previous studies, which assumed linear marginal capital loss for lack of this information, probably overestimated the fraction of a nation's coastline to be protected and protection cost. In addition, the new function can treat a sea-level rise that is nonlinear in time. As a nonlinear sea-level rise causes more costs in the future than an equivalent linear sea-level rise scenario, using the new equation with a nonlinear scenario also reduces the estimated damage and protection fraction through discounting of the costs in later periods. Numerical calculations are performed, applying the cost function to DIVA and socio-economic scenarios from the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model.",

This calculation may for practical purposes be expressed in table look-up form.\r\nThe conditions for exact reproduction of colored images should prove useful in the design and analysis of image processing systems whose final output is intended for human viewing.

        "Abstrak": "Low desire is the most common sexual dysfunction in women. Pharmaceuticals are being developed to treat it, most notably Flibanserin, owned by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Sometimes inaccurately referred to as \"female Viagra,\" Flibanserin actually treats an entirely different problem. Viagra allows men to get an erection, meaning that it treats physical arousal problems. Flibanserin, and other drugs for low sexual desire in women, act on the brain. Women with low desire don't have a problem with physical arousal or with orgasm, but with desiring sex before it starts. Most women with low sexual desire disorder have partners with higher desire than they do. So is low desire a medical, physiological problem in the brain? Or is it a sociocultural, interpersonal issue? Some experts think that the majority of women with what has been called a \"disorder\" of low sexual desire have no abnormal physiological problem, but instead are living in a sociocultural and medical system that encourages them to think of themselves as broken, and may be best treated with non-pharmaceutical methods. Other experts think that low desire is a physiological problem and drugs are important to treat it. Cultural shame around communicating about sex, undervaluing of women's sexuality compared to men's, and unrealistic sexual expectations all feed into and complicate the issue.",

        "Abstrak": "Thyroid hormone (T3) resistance is inherited in most cases in an\r\nautosomal dominant manner. The disorder is characterized by\r\nelevated free thyroid hormone levels and partial resistance to\r\nthyroid hormone at the cellular level. Distinct single amino acid\r\nsubstitutions in the ligand binding domain of the ft form of the\r\nthyroid hormone receptor have been described in two kindreds\r\nwith this disorder. We used transient expression assays to characterize\r\nthe functional properties of these receptor mutants,\r\none containing a Gly to Arg change at amino acid 340 (G340R)\r\nand the other a Pro to His change at amino acid 448 (P448H).\r\nA nine amino acid carboxy terminal deletion (A448456), analogous\r\nto an alteration that occurs in v-erbA, was also studied for\r\ncomparison with the mutations that occur in the T3 resistance\r\nsyndrome. None of the receptor mutants were able to mediate\r\nthyroid hormone dependent activation (TreTKCAT) or repression\r\n(TSHaCAT) of reporter genes when compared with the\r\nwild type receptor. In addition, the mutants inhibited the activity\r\nof normal a and (3 receptor isoforms when examined in coexpression\r\nassays. This activity, referred to as dominant negative\r\ninhibition, was manifest with respect to both the positively and\r\nnegatively regulated reporter genes. Although mutant receptor\r\nbinding to DNA was unaffected, ligand binding studies showed\r\nthat the G340R and A448456 mutants failed to bind T3,\r\nwhereas the P448H mutant bound hormone with reduced affinity\r\n(- 10% of normal) compared to the wild type receptor. Consistent\r\nwith this finding, the P448H mutant receptor was partially\r\nactive at higher T3 concentrations. Furthermore, the dominant\r\nnegative inhibition elicited by the P448H receptor mutant\r\nat higher T3 concentrations was reversed in the presence of high\r\ndoses of T3. These findings indicate that mutant (3 receptors in\r\npatients with thyroid hormone resistance have reduced affinity\r\nfor T3 and are functionally deficient, but impair the activity of\r\nnormal receptors, thereby providing a mechanism for the dominant\r\nmode of inheritance in this disorder.

The model with the highest performance achieved a sensitivity of 0.85 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.70. Of the 35 episodes of hypotension despite fluid resuscitation present in the random patient dataset, the model provided early warnings for 29 episodes with a mean early warning time of 582 ± 355 minutes.Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in severe sepsis and septic shock has shown to provide substantial benefits in patient outcomes. However, these preventive therapeutic interventions are contingent upon an early detection or suspicion of the underlying septic etiology. Detection of sepsis in the early stages can be difficult, as the initial pathogenesis can occur while the patient is still displaying normal vital signs. This study focuses on developing an early warning system (EWS) to provide clinicians with a forewarning of an impending hypotensive crisis-thus allowing for EGDT intervention. Research was completed in three main stages: (1) generating an annotated septic shock dataset, (2) constructing multivariate logistic regression EWS models using the annotated dataset, and (3) testing the EWS models in a forward, causal manner on a random cohort of patients to simulate performance in a real-life ICU setting. The annotated septic shock dataset was created using the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) database. Automated pre-annotations were generated using search criteria designed to identify two patient types: (1) sepsis patients who do not progress to septic shock, and (2) sepsis patient who progress to septic shock. Currently, manual review by expert clinicians to verify the pre-annotations has not been completed. Six separate EWS models were constructed using the annotated septic shock dataset. The multivariate logistic regression EWS models were trained to differentiate between 107 high-risk sepsis patients of whom 39 experienced a hypotensive crisis and 68 who remained stable. The models were tested using 7-fold cross validation; the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the best model was 0.940 ± 0.038.",

        "Abstrak": "Energy efficiency and demand response are critical resources for the transition to a cleaner electricity grid. Demand-side management programs can reduce electricity use during peak times when power is scarce and expensive, and they can help to integrate intermittent renewable energy resources by balancing real-time supply and demand for electricity. These programs are more cost-effective than large-scale energy storage technologies and are particularly important in cities and states with strong climate change and energy goals. Since 2000, Austin Energy has managed a residential demand response program that enables it to reduce air conditioning usage by remotely adjusting thermostat settings at tens of thousands of homes. The utility distributed free thermostats to households that participated in this program; however, by 2012, it determined that only one third of them were working as intended. During the summer of 2013, Austin Energy decided to implement a new program utilizing new technology, Wi-Fi connected \"smart\" thermostats. Instead of providing free thermostats to reduce peak demand, the utility encouraged residents to bring their own device and receive a one-time $85 enrollment incentive. This thesis analyzes these two approaches to residential demand response as measured by program enrollment rates and participant performance during demand response events. In addition, it assesses the smart thermostats' ability to reduce energy consumption (i.e. improve energy efficiency) over the course of the summer. My analysis indicates that smart thermostats were more effective at reducing peak demand than the free thermostats employed in the previous program. However, homes with smart thermostats used more energy for air conditioning over the course of the summer than homes without, indicating limited energy efficiency potential from smart thermostats among the study population.",

        "Abstrak": "The dissertation examines Ekistics, a field defined by the architect and planner Constantine Doxiadis as the \"science of human settlements\" that championed the radical expansion of architecture's scope, called for its alignment with international development, and emphasized the profession's responsibilities towards global environmental exigencies. Spanning the disciplines of architectural history, environmental history, and cultural studies, the study analyzes the intellectual lineage of Ekistics' conceptions of the global environment, and the complex historical circumstances in which they were shaped: international policies for development, postcolonial agendas of modernization and nation building, scientific controversies on global interconnectedness, and architectural critiques of modernism. The study focuses on Ekistics' planning models of \"dynapolis\" and \"ecumenopolis,\" and on physical interventions proposed by branches of Doxiadis's enterprise in the Mediterranean margins of Europe and the Middle East, where Ekistics had widespread appeal. The study also analyzes Doxiadis's relationship with key figures in postwar architectural culture, notably Jaqueline Tyrwhitt, who was also the editor of the journal Ekistics, Buckminster Fuller, who embraced Doxiadis's vision of world cities, and Hassan Fathy, who operated as a proponent of local \"traditions\" in the midst of the Ekistics group.(cont.) Furthermore, the study examines Doxiadis's and his colleagues' interpretation of such concepts as Patrick Geddes's notion of an interconnected \"environment,\" Conrad H. Waddington's notion of \"systems,\" Jean Gottman's notion of \"megalopolis,\" and Rachel Carson's notion of an ecological \"balance.\" By proposing an alternative focus on Ekistics, which for the first time examines the environmental themes underlying its transnational practice, the study fills a gap in current scholarship, by uncovering the profound impact of 1950s and 60s environmental consciousness on architectural culture, before the popularization of environmentalism in the 1970s. Furthermore, it contemplates the extent to which postwar environmental consciousness in architecture is entangled with postwar modernization and development discourses directed at the so-called third world. In the process, the study suggests that the history of postwar environment-development politics can also provide a fresh critical perspective on today's popular topic of sustainability.",

        "Abstrak": "Recent research into the mechanics of walking indicates that a quasi passive wearable device could be created which dramatically reduces the metabolic energy used in walking especially when the wearer is carrying additional torso weight. Target population groups include military personnel who must carry heavy battle packs and body armor, hikers, letter carriers, and the quasi disabled. This latter group includes a significant fraction of the elderly who have reduced leg strength and/or higher weight torsos. The device is called PUUMA, an acronym for Personal Unpowered Universal Mobility Assistant. Though walking has been studied extensively, there appears to be a limited understanding of the interplay between the kinetic and potential energy of the torso when driven by legs that can store and release energy. This thesis introduces a simplified model which enables simulation of the entire walking process including the epoch following heel strike. One simulation goal was to explore the knee spring properties which enable lossless walking. Simulations show that there are two knee spring configurations which allow for lossless walking. It is also shown that the percentage of kinetic energy transferred to a knee spring can be a significant fraction of the torso kinetic energy.(cont.) PIJUMA's basic idea is the incorporation of torsion springs at the knee joints which absorb torso kinetic energy following heel strike and then release that stored energy later in the step. An application of the capstan effect is introduced which enables a practical implementation of two knee spring configurations. In particular, the design allows the thigh and shank to be dynamically coupled to a microprocessor controlled knee spring thereby allowing both unimpeded leg swing and kinetic energy transfer to the knee spring. Another use of the capstan effect is introduced which allows for a microprocessor controlled brake that can freeze the knee at its maximum torsion and then release it later in the walking cycle. A design is shown which embodies the architectural ideas created. Several of the key components were designed, prototyped and tested.",

We find that individuals who were forced out of MA plans due to plan exit saw very large increases in hospital utilization. These increases appear to arise through plans both limiting access to nearby hospitals and reducing elective admissions, yet they are not associated with any measurable reduction in hospital quality or patient mortality.",

Multiple cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loops are thought to function together during the learning and performance of reinforced behaviors, with the dorsolateral circuit being particularly critical for the learning of habitual chains of action sequences. However, how this circuit works to generate such behavior is poorly understood. To explore the nature of striatal neural representations during learned action sequences, I designed a task targeted at disambiguating movement-related responses from habit representations in striatum. In combination with this task, I employed electrophysiology and optogenetics techniques to characterize task-related neuronal activity in the corticostriatal circuit. I found that, unlike in motor cortex, neurons in striatum did not respond simply to particular individual actions, but responded preferentially at the initiation and termination of learned action sequences. These experiments provide a test for the existence of a generalized striatal signal marking the start and end of units of habitual behaviors which may be produced with the contribution of striatal interneurons, providing a mechanism by which striatum can control the encoding and performance of chunked action sequences. In a separate set of experiments, I explored the effect of dopamine depletion on local field potential oscillations in the same region of striatum. My goal was to investigate the interaction between abnormal oscillations caused by dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease and the functional task-related oscillations that normally occur in healthy striatum. Against our expectations, I found that local unilateral dopamine depletion in dorsolateral striatum did not result in changes in pre-task baseline strength of oscillations, but rather in the overexpression of the normal task-related oscillations. These studies add support to theories of striatal function and dysfunction that emphasize selective network modulation by learned behaviors.",

Cyclic voltammetry and rotating disc electrode experiments were performed in order to evaluate the influence of platinum loading and particle size on the electrochemical active area and oxygen reduction performance of the sputtered platinum. Active area per weight catalyst decreased with sputtering time, and the oxygen reduction activity slightly increases with increasing sputtering time.

By the axioms of vertex algebras it follows that the space g of fields with conformal weight 1 is a Lie algebra, and the space U of fields with conformal weight 3/2 is a g-module with a symmetric invariant bilinear form. One of the main observations is that, under the assumption of existence of a quasi- classical limit (which basically translates to the existence of a one parameter family of vertex algebras, the free parameter being the Kac-Moody level k), the complex connected algebraic group G corresponding to the Lie algebra 0 acts transitively on the quadric ... This generalizes a similar result of Kac in the case of conformal algebras.

The solution is given by the following list ... However, if one removes the assumption of existence of quasi-classical limit, the above argument fails and the problem of classification has to be studied using different techniques. In the case in which is a simple Lie algebra and U an irreducible g- module, we will prove, under some weak technical assumption, that no examples with \"discrete\" values of the Kac-Moody level appear.",

The aesthetic revival of the mythical productive landscape that once enfolded the Alhambra dominated the experience, hence the desire to recapture - and if necessary reconstruct - the landscape of the past is always present in the literature and the restoration and conservation projects of the last two centuries.

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is about multidominance or sharing in syntax. The term sharing is used in a technical sense, to refer to a situation where a syntactic node has more than one mother. I assume that multidominance is allowed by the grammar. I argue that sharing configurations are more diverse than it has been proposed. I identify two kinds of sharing: bulk sharing and non-bulk sharing. A string of multidominated material may be shared as a single constituent, resulting in a bulk sharing structure or its subparts may be shared individually, which results in a non-bulk sharing configuration. I argue that all sharing structures are constrained by a single condition: Constraint On Sharing (COSH). COSH is a filter on derivations, which imposes an identity requirement on the sets of terminal nodes completely dominated by horizontal mothers of any shared node. Horizontal mothers are mothers that do not dominate each other. I propose that effects of COSH are reducible to conditions that must be satisfied for a structure to be linearizable. Empirical evidence for COSH and non-bulk sharing comes from Bi-Clausal Multiple Wh-questions (BMWs), which I investigate in English and Croatian.(cont.) In a BMW, two wh-phrases appear to be coordinated at the left periphery of the clause: \"What and where did Bob cook?\". I present arguments that these questions are bi-clausal, with one wh-phrase belonging to each CP conjunct. Next, I propose an analysis of BMWs that involves non-bulk sharing constrained by COSH. I argue that this analysis explains the puzzling properties that BMWs have in both languages. I show that while English has only BMWs, in Croatian there is also a construction that mimics a BMW in the surface string, but is actually a result of a very different derivation, one that involves only one clause with two wh-phrases. I refer to this structure as a Coordinated Multiple Question (CMW). I propose that the placement of second-position clitics in Croatian can disambiguate a BMW from a CMW.",

Iron was becoming the preferred material from which to make many utilitarian objects such as weapons and agricultural tools; this change can be clearly seen in the different treatments of bronze object deposits from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. The Early Iron Age hillfort settlement of Sticna in what is now southeastern Slovenia was one of the first incipient commercial centers to take advantage of the new importance placed on iron, conducting trade with Italy, Greece, the Balkans, and northern Europe. This metallurgical study of bronze funerary objects from Sticna identifies construction techniques, use patterns, and bronze metallurgical technologies from the ancient region of Lower Carniola. This information is then used to explore the cultural importance of bronze at Early Iron Age Sticna and to compare the bronze work of Lower Carniola with that of other regions in central Europe and Italy from this time of great change in Iron Age Europe.",

In this work we have applied molecular dynamics with all atom potentials in order to study the thermodynamic effect of additives on proteins. The method is based on statistical mechanical model that characterizes the preferential binding of proteins to either water or additives. Extensive study was done on model systems comprising of additives urea, glycerol & arginine hydrochloride and proteins RNaseT1 and hen egg lysozyme. Trajectories in range 10-19 nanoseconds were analyzed in order to validate this method and compared with the experimental results. The method was found to agree with experimental results for the first 2 nanoseconds and the extended runs were studied further to narrow down the cause of deviations. Protein RNaseT1 was found to be very unstable and consequently showed very high deviations in preferential binding for longer runs. Constraining the protein using harmonic potential has resulted in better averages for RNase T1.(cont.) Lysozyme has been found to be very stable and the calculations are in good agreement with experimental values. Local preferential binding calculations showed the importance of structure as well as sequence in prediction of preferential binding of protein.",

        "Abstrak": "Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is a promising technique to sustain tokamak plasmas and provide control over the current profile--two important capabilities required for the development of tokamak fusion reactors. Upgraded measurement capabilities on the Alcator C-Mod Tokamak create a unique opportunity to study the plasma's toroidal electric current profile at magnetic fields, plasma densities, and magnetic geometries anticipated in future reactors in stationary discharges dominated by lhcd. The Motional Stark Effect (MSE) diagnostic uses polarized light to infer the plasma's internal current profile. The MSE diagnostic deployed on the Alcator C-Mod Tokamak previously experienced unacceptable calibration drift and sensitivity to partially-polarized background light that limited its ability to measure magnetic field pitch-angles. A comprehensive analytic study of the origin of polarization angle errors in MSE diagnostics and an experimental study using a robotic calibration system were conducted. Insight from this study guided the fabrication and installation of a first-of-a-kind in-situ calibration system for MSE diagnostics--a long sought capability-- and the development of thermal isolation schemes for the periscope. An experimental study of the effect of partially polarized background light identified this as a significant source of systematic error. Partial-polarization upon reflection was identified as the mechanism that leads to polarized light in a tokamak. Visible bremsstrahlung, divertor emission, and blackbody emission were identified as the dominant sources of light. A new technique, MSE multi-spectral line polarization (MSE-MSLP), was developed to measure the polarization on a single sight line in multiple wavelengths simultaneously using a high-throughput polarization polychromator. Wavelength-interpolation of the background light polarization utilizing this hardware decreases the error from background subtraction by a factor of 5-10 relative to time-interpolation, drastically improving the measurement quality while eliminating the need for neutral beam pulsing. The method also allows for simultaneous measurement of multiple polarized transitions within the Stark multiplet. The upgraded MSE diagnostic was used to measure the magnetic field pitch angle profile in plasmas with some or all of the plasma current driven by lhcd. Measurements were made across a range of single-parameter scans: lhcd power, loop voltage, plasma density, plasma current, and launched n// spectrum. The current profile is observed to broaden during lhcd, but consistently has significant on-axis current density, even in fully non-inductive plasmas. The current profile and hard x-ray (HXR) profiles are observed to be most sensitive to plasma current, with higher current yielding broader profiles. The current and HXR profiles as well as global current-drive efficiency are insensitive to changes in n// or loop voltage. Numerical simulations by the ray-tracing Fokker-Planck GENRAY/CQL3D code reproduce the total measured current in non-inductive conditions but fail to accurately predict the current and HXR profiles; the simulations consistently predict more current drive in the outer half of the plasma than is observed. This leads to a flattening of the HXR profile compared to the experimental profiles. These qualitative discrepancies persist across the range of plasma parameters scanned. Varying code inputs within their measurement uncertainties and adding experimentally-constrained levels of fast-electron diffusion do not reconcile profile discrepancies. Some qualitative profile trends in single parameter scans are reproduced by the simulations including broadening of profiles at higher current, and a weak dependence on the launched n//spectrum. However, HXR profile self-similarity across different densities and powers is not reproduced. These new comparisons between profile measurements and simulation suggest that the simulations are missing important physics in this operational regime.",

        "Abstrak": "Optical communications promise the delivery of high bandwidth service to all types of customers. The potential for optical communications is enormous and has generated excitement and anticipation over the last decade. However, the emergence of a growing market has not materialized and the 1990s communications \"bubble\" has burst. One result of the bubble burst is that manufacturers of optical components have seen demand for their products plummet and are now struggling to survive. The future of the communications industry depends on its ability to provide better services and higher reliability. At some point, the upward curve of communications demand will require a strong optical components industry to support the industry. If the current stagnation continues, and the manufacturers fail, the economic pillar that is communications will suffer. The MIT Microphotonics Center has initiated a Communications Technology Roadmap study to better understand the technical, economic, and political factors that are inhibiting growth in the optical communications industry. This thesis examines the current state of the optoelectronic manufacturing industry and the causes of the decline. The primary focus is the rampant proliferation of optical transceiver designs resulting from abnormal market conditions during the \"boom years\" of the 1990s. The transceiver provides send/receiver capabilities and is the major component of optical networks. Convergence, or standardization, could potentially allow the industry to reach its full potential. System Dynamics is used to analyze transceiver standardization as a potential solution to the industry's lackluster growth.(cont.) To support the findings of the System Dynamics model, historical examples are explored to better understand the behavior of the industry and the potential effects of standardization. The industry currently offers literally hundreds of transceiver varieties. One major challenge to standardization is the development of a reasonable platform for the standard. This thesis will also examine the technical requirements of a transceiver platform and then provide a basic example of a transceiver platform before finishing with proposed policy measures that could guide the industry as it takes its first steps down the path to standardization.",

        "Abstrak": "The deployment of fuel recycling through either CONFU (COmbined Non-Fertile and UO2 fuel) thermal watercooled reactors (LWRs) or fast ABR (Actinide Burner Reactor) reactors is compared to the Once-Through LWR reactor system in terms of accumulation of actinides over the next 100 years under the assumption of a growing worldwide demand for nuclear energy. It is assumed that the growth rate is about 2.1% per year up to 2053, with alternative scenarios after that date. The transuranics (TRU) stored in temporary repositories, the TRU sent to permanent repositories, the system cost and a vulnerability index toward proliferation are calculated by the CAFCA code and taken as key figures of merit. Deployment of the ABRs is assumed to occur later (2028) than the CONFU LWRs (2015), whose technology requires less extensive additional R&D. Through 2050 the CONFU strategy performs better than the ABR strategy. The CONFU LWRs in our model yield zero net TRU incineration while the ABRs have a net consumption of TRU. Compared to the Once-Through strategy, by 2050 the CONFU (respectively ABR) strategy reduces by about 22% (respectively 16%) the total inventory of TRU in the system. This reduction corresponds to the TRU production being avoided by CONFU LWRs or being incinerated in ABRs compared to the TRU produced in the traditional LWRs used in the Once-Through strategy.(cont.) The net consumption of TRU in ABRs makes the ABR strategy more attractive in a longer term. By 2100, the ABR (respectively CONFU) strategy would have reduced the worldwide TRU inventory by 75% (respectively 58%) compared to the Once-Through case. The three strategies are also discussed with regard to uranium ore availability, repository need, and processing plants need. It is interesting to note that with either recycling strategies the total capacity for separation of spent UO2 constituents need only be four to five times the existing capacity today. Furthermore, only one TRU recycling plant from fertile-free fuel would be needed at a capacity of 250 MTHM/year up to 2050. The economic analysis shows that both closed fuel cycles are more expensive than the reference Once-Through scheme. The total cost of electricity production is expected to be 5 mills/kWhe, or about 15%, larger than the Once-Through cycle case, if the spent fuel separation is paid off by the electricity sales from the resulting fuel. The timing of collection of fuel cycle costs significantly affects the cost of electricity. Paying for fuel separation by the sales of the electricity producing the spent fuel to be reprocessed later has a smaller effect on the cost of electricity in the advanced fuel cycles (between 1 or 2 mills/kWhe or between 3 and 6%) compared to the cost of electricity in the Once-Through strategy.(cont.) From a policy point of view, an index of vulnerability toward proliferation is defined and gives an advantage to the advanced fuel cycles. The large amount of heavy metal in the repository and the long life time of this repository penalize the Once-Through strategy. However the results are sensitive to the accessibility factor assigned to the repository which is, as all accessibility factors, a subjective value that is not precisely defined. Moreover, worldwide cooperation to implement the two advanced strategies and the challenges this implementation could face are discussed. The use of a single behaviour mode throughout the world implies an unlikely perfect cooperation between countries that do not have the same capabilities or incentives to choose among the advanced fuel cycle strategies.",

        "Abstrak": "Lorentz actuator dynamics in a fluid are governed by the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and hydrodynamics and have several potential applications in the marine field. Two areas of interest where improvements would lead to significant contributions are the turbulence control and underwater acoustic communication fields. The ability to control turbulence is directly associated with controlling drag. Shipping industries and naval institutions are constantly seeking ways to reduce drag on marine vessels. A reduction in drag would have significant impact in the marine field allowing reduced vessel fuel consumption and faster marine travel. Experimental implementation for turbulence control was carried out at the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory of MIT on a flat plate setup with an integrated Lorentz actuator cassette. The data acquisition system included a dynamometer setup with integrated load cells for direct force measurements, and a Laser Doppler Velocimetry system for measuring boundary layer profiles in the flow. The results showed apparent wall shear reduction of about 30% over the Lorentz actuated cassette using the boundary layer technique but no measurable change in drag with the direct force measurement method. Most of the hardware used today in underwater acoustic communications result in a limited frequency bandwidth for data transmission and is a function of the material properties used in the design. The advantage of using Lorentz actuators for underwater sound transmission is that the frequency bandwidth is controlled by the electronics which allows us to select broader ranges of frequency transmission. A hydrophone was used to quantify acoustic noise in a conducting fluid 100 mm from the surface of a Lorentz Actuator, and was measured to be 160 dB at a frequency range from 1 kHz to 20kHz. This frequency range was limited by the driver electronics available at the time of testing, however we expect an actual range up to 100 kHz with our new equipment.",

The EU directives on End-of-life vehicles try to push the recycling process further: it fixed the percentage of recyclability (85%) and recoverability (95%) automotive companies have to reach for their new vehicles in 2015. Complying with these directives will imply a cost, which will be borne by one or several of the stakeholders of the automotive life cycle. This cost will not only depend on the type of the vehicle but also on where the vehicle will be recycled and which recycling processes will be used. The scope of this thesis is to study the recycling cost sensitivity to regional practices and to vehicle's type. A technical cost model has been developed to calculate the cost of applying the regulation. Based on the list of parts of a particular vehicle, this tool allows to determine which parts have to be removed to reach the recycling target and the cost associated with this removal. The model was run for a sample group of vehicles and for different regional inputs. The goal is to pinpoint the major recycling cost drivers and discuss how the total cost can be reduced.

The Personal Router is able to select and negotiate connectivity with local providers for different kinds of services and interfaces. It needs payment procedures to support these services. As this device is designed to be used in many distinct unpredictable contexts, it cannot implement a single payment system. The complexity of existing payment systems has to be mapped into this new environment. A different payment system must be chosen each time, depending on many variables such as costs, environmental constraints, privacy, user and provider's needs and preferences. Privacy is a major issue for this device. In effect, getting wireless and mobile service everywhere will possibly leave an easily traceable trail; moreover, using this device supposes negotiating with many different untrusted providers and paying for the service. This can create huge potential threats for privacy and personal data management if this issue is not included in the early stage of the design. Legal requirements and user preferences and expectations for privacy in electronic transactions are therefore explored. Past attempts to enhance privacy in different environments are examined. Reasons why most of them have failed and some of them are struggling to stay alive are analyzed. New privacy threats faced by the Personal Router are considered. A new approach based on building blocks is made. Payment systems are split into primitive operations; each of them implements one step of a transaction. The combination of these building blocks replicates a payment protocol. The characteristics of a payment system can then be derived from the analysis of the implementation of each of these primitives. Users' preferences are defined by attributes. Payment systems can then be compared through their primitives and even slightly modified to be closer to users' ideal system by altering the primitives. The modular approach makes this easier. This framework is successfully tested on three major electronic payment systems. Several limitations of this approach and open issues related to the Personal Router are exposed.",

        "Abstrak": "Even with advances in vehicle technology, both conservation and methods for reducing the fuel consumption of existing vehicles are needed to decrease the petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet. One way to do this is through changes in driving style, specifically through reductions in driving aggressiveness. The role of vehicle performance is particularly interesting because of the recognized tradeoff between vehicle performance and certified fuel consumption and because more powerful vehicles are capable of more aggressive driving. This thesis analyzes the effects of driving style and vehicle performance on the real-world fuel consumption of conventional vehicles though two parts. First, vehicle simulations assess the sensitivity of fuel consumption to a wide range of driving patterns. From these results, three aggressiveness factors were developed for quantifying driving aggressiveness. Each aggressiveness factor, although based only on the speed trace and vehicle characteristics, is proportional to fuel consumption in one of three specific speed ranges: neighborhood, city, or highway speeds. These aggressiveness factors provide a tool for comparing drive cycles and evaluating the real-world driving patterns. Second, driving data from two U.S. sources was used to 1) provide illustrative examples of real world driving and 2) assess the relationship between driving aggressiveness and vehicle performance. The distribution of aggressiveness among the driving data follows a lognormal shape. The average aggressiveness is either below or near the aggressiveness of the U.S. drive cycles developed in the 1990s. Moderate performance vehicles, the most common type of vehicle, are driven most aggressively. Low performance vehicles are driven least aggressively. The results suggest that, for the illustrative data analyzed in this work, reducing velocities during highway driving would save roughly the same amount of fuel as reducing accelerations during all driving. However, on an individual basis, the fuel savings achieved from these behaviors would vary significantly. Aggressive drivers should focus on reducing accelerations, while less aggressive drivers should focus on driving at lower speeds on the highway. And the greatest fuel savings can be attained if the most aggressive drivers, those who drive moderate performance vehicles, drove with lower accelerations.",

        "Abstrak": "Recent genomic studies of the Y chromosome revealed massive, testis-specific palindromes that span 30% of the chromosome and are subject to gene conversion. We conducted studies to determine whether similar palindromes exist on the human X chromosome and, if they exist, to what degree they share the features of the Y chromosome palindromes. We performed an electronic search for palindromes on the human X chromosome resulting in the identification of 24 palindromes comprising 1.8% of the chromosome. The palindromes consist of sequences 9.5 to more than 140 kilobases long duplicated in inverted orientation separated by a 0.2 to 164 kilobase spacer. The paired palindrome arms display greater than 99 percent nucleotide identity. We determined the palindrome associated gene content and experimentally evaluated their transcription range. All the genes residing in palindrome arms and spacers are transcribed in the testis, with almost two thirds predominantly testis-transcribed. To determine if the testis-transcription bias is due to a chromosome-wide enrichment for testis-transcribed genes, we used publicly available expression data to compare the ratio of palindrome-associated X-linked testis genes with non-palindrome-associated X-linked testis genes. We confirmed that the proportion of testis genes in palindromes is significantly different than that of testis genes on the entire X chromosome. We pursued a comparative sequencing strategy to trace the evolution of the X chromosome palindromes. We sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) from chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus monkey genomic libraries containing sequence orthologous to several of the human X chromosome palindromes. We found some of the palindromes conserved in all species(cont.) the origins of these palindromes before the rhesus monkey and human lineages split 25 million years ago. Despite their ancient origin, all of the palindromes studied display greater than 99 percent nucleotide identity between paired arms, suggesting that gene conversion between palindrome arms maintains the arm to arm similarity. We also uncovered insertions and deletions between orthologous palindrome arms that had been subsequently homogenized to the opposite arm of the palindrome. The largest deletion of 14.5 kilobases is the largest known example of a gene conversion homogenized indel in mammals.",

The motivation stemmed from the need for air pollution mitigation in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The research analyzed three cases of environmental technology introduction in passenger vehicles, and synthesized the case findings into a conceptual model. The case studies were complemented with quantitative analyses of parameters of national technological capability acquisition, and scenario analysis of emission mitigation potential. The research showed that environmental technological change in the Mexican auto sector is increasingly influenced by external factors, specifically global sector development and conditions in countries with major auto producers and export markets. Environmental technological change could be articulated within the framework of conventional technological change, with some differences, such as: the need to account for environmental policy as a distinct factor, different motivations of private sector actors in acquiring technological capabilities and deploying technology, and interactions and conflicts between environmental policy and other factors, which can create barriers. The research found that environmental policy is a necessary but not sufficient factor to induce environmental technological change in Mexico. Environmental policy did and does influence environmental technological change by specifying the time and pacing of technology introduction. The scenario analysis showed the projected effectiveness of technology options.(cont.) Recommendations for the Mexican policymakers include: (1) the role and limitations of environmental policy in the process of environmental technological change should be recognized; (2) policymakers should strive to minimize institutional fragmentation, which undermines policy implementation; (3) vehicle technology options should be considered further, due to their effectiveness, and political and institutional feasibility; (4) the environmental authorities are likely to encounter opposition to Mexico-specific technology requirements, particularly if they are more stringent than in the US or Europe; and (5) the authorities' ability to benefit from the export platform to introduce advanced technologies in Mexico will be diminished if export markets shift towards markets with less stringent emission standards than the US and Europe.",

        "Abstrak": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. The disease is characterized by neurodegeneration and formation of neuronal intracellular inclusions primarily in the striatum and cortex, leading to personality changes, motor impairment, and dementia. To date, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the neurodegenerative process remain to be defined. Development of transgenic Drosophila HD models may facilitate dissection of molecular and cellular pathways that lead to disease pathology and suggest potential strategies for treatment. To explore mutant Htt-mediated mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction, we generated transgenic Drosophila that express the first 548 amino acids of the human Htt gene with either a pathogenic polyglutamine tract of 128 repeats (Htt-Q128) or a nonpathogenic tract of 0 repeats (Htt-QO). Characterization of these transgenic lines indicates formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic Htt aggregates in our Drosophila HD model that sequester other non-nuclear polyQ-containing proteins and block axonal transport.(cont.) To further explore axonal transport defects in Huntington's disease, we generated Drosophila transgenic strains expressing 588 aa or exon 1 N-terminal fragments of human huntingtin encoding pathogenic (HttQ138) or nonpathogenic (HttQ15) proteins tagged with mRFP and/or eGFP. These transgenic lines enable in vivo imaging of Htt aggregation and trafficking in live Drosophila, providing a unique resource for tracking Htt in real time. Our findings indicate that expression of mutant Htt may impair axonal transport through both aggregate-dependent and -independent means. Finally, to assay the therapeutic effect of expression of an intracellular antibody (intrabody) against Htt, we generated double transgenic lines coexpressing pathogenic Htt (mRFP-HttQ138) with the V12.3 intrabody. Intrabody expression caused suppression of aggregation in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, but failed to rescue mutant Htt-mediated cellular dysfunction. In summary, our Drosophila HD model provides an ideal in vivo system for examination of mutant Htt-mediated cellular defects, particularly impairment of axonal transport, and may facilitate rapid development and validation of potential treatments for Huntington's disease.",

        "Abstrak": "The availability of the human and mouse genome sequences has spurred a growing interest in analyzing mouse models of human cancer using genomic techniques. Comparative genomic studies on mouse and human tumors can be valuable in two major ways: in validating mouse models and in identifying genes that are common to mouse and human tumorigenesis. Many analytic tools have emerged in recent years for human genome mining. Some of these tools have been translated to the murine versions. The work in this thesis described the application of two new whole-genome analytic techniques to study mouse tumorigensis: Representational Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (ROMA) for tumor DNA copy number asessment and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using the SNaPshotM system (Applied Biosystems) to detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in mouse tumors. The murine version of ROMA was tested on DNA from early-stage KrasGJ2D-derived lung cancers and metastatic retinoblastoma in mice with retinal-specific Rb and p130 deletions. We were interested in identifying the additional genetic lesions that got positively selected during tumorigenesis of these mice.(cont.) Several recurrent chromosomal copy number gains and losses were observed in the DNA of KrasGJ2D-derived lung tumors. In addition, a focal amplification of the murine N-Myc locus was detected in the metastatic retinoblastomas, demonstrating the capability of ROMA to detect copy number changes at a single-gene resolution. For genome-wide allelotyping, a panel of 147 mouse SNPs were individually validated in 129S4/SvJae vs. C57BL/6J strains and were chosen as markers in the genotyping panel. We worked out a multiplex protocol to genotype the SNPs in an efficient manner. Through this protocol, we generated low-density global LOH maps of lung tumors from mice expressing KrasG12D. LOH that spanned entire chromosomes was seen in a subset of the tumors. A loss of the wild-type p53 allele was also observed in some cases.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis hypothesized that extensive telecommunications liberalization would not increase the penetration rate of the fixed telephone service better than other, less competition-oriented, policy alternatives. The hypothesis was validated in the case of Thailand and the Philippines. However, for the cellular mobile telephone and Internet services, extensive telecommunications liberalization could increase the penetration rates better than other, less competition-oriented, policy alternatives. Thus, the thesis demonstrates that past research has not paid sufficient attention to this issue and has assumed that the more extensive reform could lead to the faster and the better telecommunications development of all telecommunication services. The thesis suggested that less-developed countries (LDCs) should realize that they do not have to fully implement liberalization reforms, but should instead specifically tailor their telecommunications reform policies to their own pace and needs. This study found that extensive liberalization reforms or extensive opening of the market does not necessarily increase penetration rates of services better than other less competition-oriented policy alternatives under the following conditions: Assuming that the services have not yet reached their saturation levels based on the S-curve,(cont.) 1. Users perceive the service as a necessity; and 2. the government perceives the service as a basic necessity; and 3. the government strictly commits and implements purposeful policies with the intention of increasing penetration rates of the services through the distribution of service provision authority. Or, 4. If the liberalization is implemented after the saturation level of the service is reached. The thesis results have the policy implication that liberalization can be a useful and effective alternative to lead to higher penetration rates, when and only if, the country and its people understand its goals, effects and implications and, more importantly, when the government provides the policy framework for universal service for the benefits of its people so that the liberalization can lead to self-sustainable development.",

        "Abstrak": "Recycling, especially paper recycling, has become a de-facto public policy during the last three decades of the 20th Century. At the cusp of the new millennium it receives widespread support. Unfortunately, at the same time, this well-intentioned and locally rational action has also been soundly criticized based on the observed market instabilities in the industry that are the cause of poor performance by firms. This poor performance, especially in the case of paper, threatens the value and usefulness of recycling as an environmental strategy. Many current works that address recycling issues fail to recognize that the basis for the behavior, problematic or otherwise, is the linked set of markets that cause the materials, in the form of products and by-products, to flow through the entire macroeconomy. The sources of this behavior include both the internal structure of the sectors from which the markets are comprised as well as the linkages between the markets. To understand the potential problems in the paper recovery and associated markets and to assess remedies, this thesis develops and explores a new, integrated, macroeconomic model using the system dynamics method. The model is calibrated to paper material-flow-related data. It replicates problematic behaviors in the paper market, and describes their genesis, and forecasts their effects for the future. Analyses undertaken with the model also describe outcomes from several different commonly proposed interventions in terms of market stability, production, profitability, resource utilization, and overall recovery.",

        "Abstrak": "In the future, it is unlikely that complex system products will compete solely on the basis of technical performance. What will differentiate such systems and their developers is the ability to balance all the dimensions of product performance, including product pricing and timing (which are functions inclusive of development cost and cycle time). Furthermore, this balance must be congruent with customers' perceptions of value. Once this value is ascertained or approximated, complex system developers will require the capability to adjust the design process to meet these expectations. The required amount and sophistication of project planning, control, information, and flexibility is unprecedented. The primary goal of this work is a method to help managers integrate process and design information in a way that supports making decisions that yield products congruent with customer desires and strategic business goals.  This work consists of three parts. Part one contains two exploratory studies that further understanding of complex system product development processes. One study explores process iteration and seeks to explain why some aircraft development programs do not address iteration with existing project planning and control methods. The other study examines sources of risk, classifying these into six categories (cost, schedule, performance, technology, business, and market risks) and building causal frameworks to represent their relationships. Both studies point to avenues for improving existing process '·models and in some cases reveal process characteristics requiring new methods. These results, while derived from projects in the aerospace industry, are highly applicable across a variety of complex system development projects.  Part two entails an effort to model some of the characteristics observed in part one. After a review of four types of dependency structure matrices (DSMs), notably the activity-based or schedule DSM, extensive data are collected from an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) design process. Part two thus describes how to build a DSM model and provides data for example applications of the detailed models developed in part three.  Based on the foundational work of parts one and two, part three develops a new methodology and models for understanding product development process cost, schedule, and performance. The methodology complements activity-centric schedule models such as DSM in that activities provide direct contributions to process cost and schedule and design performance. This approach sets the stage for integrated cost, schedule, and performance analyses. A cost and schedule model is presented first, and it is extended to account for the effects of activities on product performance. The stochastic, simulation model generates distributions of possible cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. These distributions represent uncertainty and are analyzed in relation to impact functions and targets to determine levels of risk. The model outputs enable the exploration of the costs and benefits of several management options and yield interesting insights. The goal is to improve product development planning and control though the capability to balance cost, schedule, and performance appropriately.",

        "Abstrak": "We investigate the options for enhancing the welfare of small farmers in Thailand through subsidies of irrigation infrastructure. Enhanced water storage and irrigation can significantly improve yield and the welfare of the farm community by providing a more reliable water supply during growing periods. Generally speaking, such enhancements require subsidies from the government or other organizations since farmers are not able or willing to finance infrastructure development themselves. In order to maximize the effectiveness of such subsidies it is important to understand how farmers will react to alternative policies. We develop a two-tier approach to this problem. First, we use a government-level optimization model to identify the set of subsidies and water pricing policies that maximizes a stated measure of aggregate social welfare. This government-level model relies on a farm-level model that determines how individual small farmers will react to the policy alternatives. The farm-level model combines hydrologic, economic, and agronomic features since it considers how hydrologic variability affects crop yield, which in turn affects the farmer's utility. Policy decision variables considered in the government subsidy/pricing model include 1) water price and the number of farms served by public storage facilities (i. e. a water supply reservoir and enhanced in-stream storage), 2) maximum sizes of on-farm ponds paid for by the government, and 3) amounts of direct cash subsidies paid to the farmer. The objective is to maximize the aggregate welfare of all farmers served subject to a limit on the total subsidy as well as constraints designed to limit inequities and urban migration. The problem is solved with a deterministic nonlinear programming algorithm.(cont.) Decision variables considered in the farm-level model include 1) whether or not to accept a government-subsidized on-farm pond (which reduces land available for cultivation), 2) how much to consume in each year, 3) whether to devote time to agriculture or off-farm employment, 4) type of crop and irrigation technique, and 5) amount of water purchased from communal storage facilities. The problem is solved using a finite-horizon discrete-time stochastic programming algorithm. Our modeling approach is tested on a study site in Saraburi Province, Thailand. This site serves as a suitable prototype because of its existing irrigation infrastructure, relatively developed market institutions, secure land-use rights, and weak endowment of water resources. To achieve an economic optimum in which the farmers' aggregate utility of consumption is maximized, the government must provide some farmers with free reservoir water. The remaining farmers, however, help pay for the subsidy at a relatively high price. Consequently, the latter seek urban employment during the dry seasons. This cross-subsidy solution resulting from the social optimum criteria is economically efficient yet markedly inequitable. In order to assure equity, the government should construct the reservoir and sell the storage water at the same price to all farms. However, this solution cannot prevent urban migration ...",

The conventional protocols of generating LTP have been 1. tetanic stimulation of presynaptic cell, 2. theta burst stimulation of presynaptic cell, and 3. correlated stimulation of pre- and post-synaptic cells. However, the effects of different Ca2+ influx can not be precisely dissected with the conventional protocols for the following defects: 1. the protocols do not discriminate between pre- and post-synaptic side plasticity, 2. the protocols observe synaptic plasticity between two cells which involve multiple synapses with heterogeneous properties, 3. precise control and measurement of the amount of Ca2+ influx are not possible in the protocols. In the present experiment, we perfused glutamate directly on to a single postsynaptic site, depolarized the postsynaptic intracellular potential to a controlled voltage for a controlled duration of time, thus controlling the opening of postsynaptic NMDA receptors and Ca2+ influx. By using this method, we found 1. that modification of synaptic strength has a bell-shaped dependency to the amount of Ca2+ influx, 2. that weak Ca2+ current through desensitized NMDA receptors sustained for a long period of time (160 ms) generates LTD, 3. evidence that phosphorylation of AMPAR leads to insertion of AMPAR.",

        "Abstrak": "Designing phononic crystals by creating frequency bandgaps is of particular interest in the engineering of elastic and acoustic microstructured materials. Mathematically, the problem of optimizing the frequency bandgaps is often nonconvex, as it requires the maximization of the higher indexed eigenfrequency and the minimization of the lower indexed eigenfrequency. A novel algorithm [1] has been previously developed to reformulate the original nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problem to an iteration-specific semidefinite program (SDP). This algorithm separates two consecutive eigenvalues — effectively maximizing bandgap (or bandwidth) — by separating the gap between two orthogonal subspaces, which are comprised columnwise of “important” eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues being bounded. By doing so, we avoid the need of computation of eigenvalue gradient by computing the gradient of affine matrices with respect to the decision variables. In this work, we propose an even more efficient algorithm based on linear programming (LP). The new formulation is obtained via approximation of the semidefinite cones by judiciously chosen linear bases, coupled with “delayed constraint generation”. We apply the two convex conic formulations, namely, the semidefinite program and the linear program, to solve the bandgap optimization problems. By comparing the two methods, we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the LP-based algorithm in solving the category of eigenvalue bandgap optimization problems.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis presents methods to analyze the function of vocalizations of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. The thesis uses the social interaction as the basic unit of analysis, and maintains a deliberate focus on quantitative and replicable analyses throughout. A method for determining identity of the vocalizing animal in a lagoon was developed. This method combined passive acoustic localization with video sampling to determine which animal vocalized. It fills an urgent need for unbiased identification of vocalizations of undisturbed dolphins where details of social interactions can be followed without affecting the behavior of the subjects. This method was implemented in a captive lagoon with 6 dolphins: two adult females, their two male calves, and a juvenile male and a juvenile female. This thesis also reviews the current state of analysis of the bottlenose dolphin acoustic repertoire, highlighting the need for a detailed, quantitative, and consistent study of the entire vocal repertoire. It does not attempt to do a comprehensive repertoire study, but uses several new quantitative methods to parameterize vocalizations and relate these to behavior from dolphins. Vocalizations within the lagoon tended to occur around the time of onset of behaviors produced by the focal dolphin. A comparison of vocalizations during affiliative and agonistic interactions revealed that the association of group vocalizations with the behavior of a focal animal was related to agonistic but not affiliative interactions.Using the localization/video method, vocalizations in a time window around submissive behaviors were localized and classified as having come from either dolphins engaged in the interaction or dolphins not engaged in the interaction. Vocalizations were emitted by interactants more often than expected, and by non-interactants less often than expected. Use of different vocalization types was found to vary depending on the context of the agonistic interaction. In addition, the sequence of vocalizations with respect to behaviors within the interaction mattered, with more vocalizations occurring after than before submissive behaviors. These results demonstrated that group-based analyses of vocalizations are insufficient and one must use techniques designed to focus on the level of the interaction in order to study communication and social behavior in dolphins.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis takes a look at the near boundary flow about fish-like swimming bodies. Experiments were performed up to Reynolds number 106 using laser Doppler velocimetry and particle imaging techniques. The turbulence in the boundary layer of a waving mat and swimming robotic fish were investigated. How the undulating motion of the boundary controls both the turbulence production and the boundary layer development is of great interest. Unsteady motions have been shown effective in controlling flow. Tokumaru and Dimotakis (1991) demonstrated the control of vortex shedding, and thus the drag on a bluff body, through rotary oscillation of the body at certain frequencies. Similar results of flow control have been seen in fish-like swimming motions. Taneda and Tomonari (1974) illustrated that, for phase speeds greater than free stream velocity, traveling wave motion of a boundary tends to retard separation and reduce near-wall turbulence. In order to perform experiments on a two-dimensional waving plate, an apparatus was designed to be used in the MIT Propeller tunnel, a recirculating water tunnel. It is an eight-link piston driven mechanism that is attached to a neoprene mat in order to create a traveling wave motion down the mat. A correlation between this problem and that of a swimming fish is addressed herein, using visualization results obtained from a study of the MIT RoboTuna. The study of the MIT RoboTuna and a two-dimensional representation of the backbone of the robotic swimming fish was performed to further asses the implications of such motion on drag reduction. PIV experiments with the MIT RoboTuna indicate a laminarisation of the near boundary flow for swimming cases compared with non-swimming cases along the robot body. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and PIV experiments were performed.(cont.) LDV results show the reduction of turbulence intensity, near the waving boundary, for increasing phase speed up to 1.2 m/s after which the intensities begin to increase again through Cp = 2.0 where numerical simulations by Zhang (2000) showed separation reappearing on the back of the crests. Velocity profiles who an acceleration of the fluid beyond the inflow speed at the crest region increases with increased phase speed and no separation was present in the trough for the moving wall. The experimental techniques used are also discussed as they are applied in these experiments.",

Denitrification in these sediments was driven by the degradation of labile organic matter pools which are depleted during long incubations. Sediment thickness was the most important parameter controlling the required incubation time. Errors of up to 13% with gas headspaces and 80% with water headspaces resulted from headspace N2 accumulation and the resulting collapse of the sediment-water diffusion gradient. These errors could be eliminated by using headspaces of sufficient thickness. Headspace flushing to reduce ammonium accumulation did not affect denitrification rates, but caused transient disturbance of N₂ flux rates. Direct measurements of 0₂, C0₂, N₂, and inorganic N fluxes from the sediments of a salt marsh tidal creek were made in order to examine the interaction of denitrification with the carbon, oxygen, and N cycles. Organic carbon concentration and lability were the primary controls on metabolic rates. C0₂/N flux ratios averaged 6.1, indicating respiration driven by algal biomass.(cont.) Allochthonous denitrification accounted for 39% of total sediment denitrification (2.7 mol N m⁻² yr⁻¹). 46% of remineralized ammonium was denitrified, while the contribution of autochthonous denitrification to 0₂ and C0₂ fluxes was 18% and 10%, respectively. A ¹⁵N-ammonium tracer was used to study competition between plants and nitrifying bacteria for remineralized ammonium. In undisturbed sediments of Spartina alterniflora, plant uptake out-competed nitrification-denitrification, with plant uptake accounting for 66% of remineralized ammonium during the growing season. Under N fertilization (15.5 mol m⁻² yr⁻¹), both plant N uptake and denitrification increased, but denitrification dominated, accounting for 72% of the available N. When plant uptake was hydrologically suppressed, nitrification-denitrification was stimulated by the excess N, shifting the competitive balance toward denitrification.",

        "Abstrak": "Predictions of chlorophyll concentration from satellite ocean color are an indicator of phytoplankton primary productivity, with implications for foodweb structure, fisheries, and the global carbon cycle. Current models describing the relationship between optical properties and chlorophyll do not account for much of the optical variability observed in natural waters, because of the presence of seawater constituents that do not covary with phytoplankton pigment concentration. In an attempt to better understand variability in these models, the contributions of seawater constituents to ocean optical properties were investigated. A combination of Mie theory and flow cytometry was used to determine the diameter, complex refractive index (n+n'i), and optical cross-sections of individual particles, based on a method developed in the laboratory using phytoplankton cultures. Individual particle measurements were used to interpret variability in concurrently measured bulk optical properties in New England continental shelf waters in two seasons. The summed contribution to scattering of individual particles in the size range of 0.1-50 Cpm accounted for approximately the entire scattering coefficient measured independently using bulk methods. In surface waters in both seasons, the large diameters and n' of eukaryotic phytoplankton caused them to be the main particle contributors to both absorption and scattering. Minerals were the main contributor to backscattering, bb, in the spring, whereas in the summer both minerals and detritus contributed to bb. Synechococcus and heterotrophic bacteria were less important optically, contributing <11% each to attenuation in either season.(cont.) The role of seawater constituents in determining remote sensing reflectance, Rrs, was determined using radiative transfer theory. Seasonal differences in the spectral shape of Rrs were contributed to approximately equally by eukaryotic phytoplankton absorption, dissolved absorption, and non-phytoplankton bb. A higher inverse wavelength dependence of non-phytoplankton bb in the summer was caused by the contribution of small detritus, in contrast to larger minerals in the spring. Measurements of bb and Rrs were compared to values from bio-optical models based on chlorophyll concentration. Differences in measured and modeled bb and Rrs were caused by higher dissolved absorption and higher backscattering efficiencies and scattering by non-phytoplankton than were assumed by the model.",

        "Abstrak": "A numerical model of the tropical Atlantic ocean is used to investigate the upper layer pathways of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in the tropical Atlantic. The main focus of this thesis is on those parts of the tropical circulation that are thought to be important for the MOC return flow, but whose dynamics have not been understood yet. It is shown how the particular structure of the tropical gyre and the MOC act to inhibit the flow of North Atlantic water into the equatorial thermocline. As a result, the upper layers of the tropical Atlantic are mainly fed by water from the South Atlantic. The processes that carry the South Atlantic water across the tropical Atlantic into the North Atlantic as part of the MOC are described here, and three processes that were hitherto not understood are explained as follows: The North Brazil Current rings are created as the result of the reflection of Rossby waves at the South American coast. These Rossby waves are generated by the barotropically unstable North Equatorial Countercurrent. The deep structure of the rings can be explained by merger of the wave's anticyclones with the deeper intermediate eddies that are generated as the intermediate western boundary current crosses the equator. The bands of strong zonal velocity in intermediate depths along the equator have hitherto been explained as intermediate currents. Here, an alternative interpretation of the observations is offered: The Eulerian mean flow along the equator is negligible and the observations are the signature of strong seasonal Rossby waves. The previous interpretation of the observations can then be explained as aliasing of the tropical wave field.(cont.) The Tsuchyia Jets are driven by the Eliassen-Palm flux of the tropical instability waves. The equatorial current system with its strong shears is unstable and generates tropical instability waves. These waves cause a poleward temperature flux which steepens the isotherms which in turn generates are geostrophically balanced zonal flow. In the eastern part of the basin this zonal flow feeds the southeastward flow of the equatorial gyre.",

It is shown that both integral boundary layer theory and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes algorithms provide the same over-prediction of lift forces when properly converged. It is also shown that the over-prediction is insensitive to turbulence model details. Experimentation and computational fluid dynamics modeling show that discrete vortices are shed with significant sizes and distinct frequencies. These vortices are shown to result in significant cfd prediction errors when they are asymmetric in size or shape. Inaccuracies in flow predictions in the near wake appear to result in an effective change in the Kutta Condition due to pressure biasing associated with vortex asymmetry. The net result is a consistent overprediction of mean lift. Based on an analysis of over 1000 historical experiments an empirical model is developed to allow the error in predicted lift coefficient to be anticipated based on the local flow conditions at the trailing edge of the foil. A series of experiments are conducted and reported to test the accuracy of the empirical model. The result is a significant improvement in mean lift prediction and pressure profile for both RANS and IBLT.",

Because of fixed ordering and shipping costs, this concave cost network flow problem is in a class of NP-hard network design problems. We develop mathematical programming formulations, heuristic algorithms, and enhanced algorithms using approximate dynamic programming (ADP). We achieve a strong mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation, and fast, reliable algorithms, which can be extended to problems with multiple products.  Beginning with a lot-size based formulation, we strengthen the formulation in steps to develop one which is a variation of a node-arc formulation for the network design problem. In addition, we present a path-flow formulation for the single product case and an enhanced network design formulation for the multiple product case.  The basic algorithm we develop uses a dynamic lot-size model with backlogging together with a greedy procedure that emulates inventory pull systems. Four re­lated algorithms perform local searches of the basic algorithm's solution or explore alternative solutions using pricing schemes, including a Lagrangian-based heuristic.  We show how approximate dynamic programming can be used to solve this sup­ply chain optimization problem as a dynamic control problem using any of the five algorithms. In addition to improving all the algorithms, the ADP enhancement turns the simplest algorithm into one comparable to the more complex ones.  Our computational results illustrate that our enhanced network design formula­tion almost always produces integral solutions and can be used to solve problems of moderate size (3 distribution centers, 30 stores, 30 periods). Our heuristic methods, particularly those enhanced by ADP methods, produce near optimal solutions for truly large scale problems.",

The rich life is supported by huge energy consumption and the energy consumption by human beings destroys natural balance of the earth. As consumption of oil is one of the highest contributors of greenhouse gases emissions, we need to reduce oil consumption- in order to cope with global warming. For oil companies, this is a tough business circumstance. Oil demand will diminish and oil companies will face severer competition and need to contribute energy conservation as well. This thesis analyses business circumstance of oil business in Japan and competences of ExxonMobil Japan and argues its future strategy. The analysis found that a competition in Japanese oil industry is a price competition and core competencies are all to compete price competition. The competition will be keener due to diminished oil demand. The argument suggests that the company should change its product from oil to service related to oil. Though the differentiation of oil product is difficult because of the quality regulations, services can be differentiated. As services can be improved by the feedback from customers. getting information on customer needs is another key issue. The thesis recommends that the company should collaborate with other industries and provide services beyond the current industry boundary.",

In order to support the development of DP tools and other improved methods for departure operations, this thesis is an effort to gain a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics of the departure process based on field observations and data analysis conducted at Boston Logan International Airport. It was observed that the departure process is a complex interactive queuing system and a highly controlled system as the air traffic controllers manage the traffic. Based on these observations, a core departure process abstraction was posed which consists of a queuing element that represents the delays and a control element that represents the air traffic controller actions. Namely, the abstraction represents the control element by blocking the flow of aircraft in order to maintain the safe operation of the airport resources according to the A TC rules and procedures and to regulate the outbound flow to constrained downstream resources. Based on this physical abstraction, an analytical queuing framework was posed and used to analyze the departure process dynamics under different scenarios: the overall departure process between pushback and takeoff, departure sub-processes between controller/pilot communication events and under the effect of downstream restrictions. Passing was used as a manifestation of the control behavior, where passing results mainly from sequencing of aircraft and their suspension under special circumstances such as downstream restrictions. Insights about the departure process queuing dynamics and control behavior are discussed. In particular it was observed that at Logan airport there is a high level of uncertainty and a limited level of sequencing control, hindering the ability of the air traffic controllers to manage the traffic efficiently and in compliance with restrictions.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation asks two main questions for Turkish: (i) what is the interaction between verbal morphology and the structure?, and (ii) what is the interaction between word order and interpretation? Following Kornfilt (1996) I argue that there are two verbal forms in finite structures: one consists of a participle and a copula, which is inflected for tense and agreement, and the other is a fully inflected verbal form. I propose that the former is formed by a derivation in which the verb moves as far as a functional head such Aspect or Modal, creating a participle. A verbal feature (copula) is inserted at T⁰ satisfying its verbal requirement. In the latter case the verb moves all the way up to T⁰. No copula is inserted. The rest of the dissertation focuses on the interaction between structure and quantificational elements. One question addressed is why indefinites marked overtly for accusative case violate scope rigidity, and are interpreted as having wide scope over quantificational elements c-commanding them. It is argued that they do not violate scope rigidity, but rather the unexpected wide scope interpretation is the result of a special interpretative mechanism.(cont.) Accusative-marked indefinites are interpreted as choice functions. Structures with various quantifiers, indefinites and negative polarity items are discussed, and it is argued that the interpretation of both choice function variables and negative polarity items are subject to intervention effects. Finally, structures with clausal possessives are analyzed. The discussion focuses on one type of clausal possessive in which the possessor is in the genitive case and the possessee agrees with the possessor. It is shown that this construction is subject to a constraint similar to the there-sentences in English in that the possessee cannot be presuppositional. It is argued that the possessor is generated in a constituent within VP with the possessee, but raises to the [Spec, TP]. The possessee remains within VP, and is interpreted non-presuppositionally.",

In this study we propose to enhance urban planning by taking into a consideration individual preferences using information from an unconventional big data source: dataset of geo-tagged photographs that people take in cities which we then use as a measure of urban attractiveness. We discover and compare a temporal behavior of residents and visitors in ten most photographed cities in the world. Looking at the periodicity in urban attractiveness, the results show that the strongest periodic patterns for visitors are usually weekly or monthly. Moreover, by dividing cities into two groups based on which continent they belong to (i.e., North America or Europe), it can be concluded that unlike European cities, behavior of visitors in the US cities in general is similar to the behavior of their residents. Finally, we apply two indices, called “dilatation attractiveness index” and “dilatation index”, to our dataset which tell us the spatial and temporal attractiveness pulsations in the city. The proposed methodology is not only important for urban planning, but also does support various business and public stakeholder decision processes, concentrated for example around the question how to attract more visitors to the city or estimate the impact of special events organized there.",

        "Abstrak": "This work addresses two related questions.  The first question is what joint time-frequency  energy representations are most appropriate  for auditory signals, in particular, for speech  signals in sonorant regions. The quadratic  transforms of the signal are examined, a large  class that includes, for example, the  spectrograms and the Wigner distribution.  Quasi-stationarity is not assumed, since this  would neglect dynamic regions. A set of  desired properties is proposed for the  representation: (1) shift-invariance, (2)  positivity, (3) superposition, (4) locality, and (5)  smoothness. Several relations among these  properties are proved: shift-invariance and  positivity imply the transform is a  superposition of spectrograms; positivity and  superposition are equivalent conditions when  the transform is real; positivity limits the  simultaneous time and frequency resolution  (locality) possible for the transform, defining  an uncertainty relation for joint time-frequency  energy representations; and locality and  smoothness tradeoff by the 2-D generalization  of the classical uncertainty relation. The  transform that best meets these criteria is  derived, which consists of two-dimensionally  smoothed Wigner distributions with (possibly  oriented) 2-D guassian kernels. These  transforms are then related to time-frequency  filtering, a method for estimating the time-varying 'transfer function' of the vocal tract,  which is somewhat analogous to ceptstral  filtering generalized to the time-varying case.  Natural speech examples are provided. The  second question addressed is how to obtain  a rich, symbolic description of the phonetically  relevant features in these time-frequency  energy surfaces, the so-called schematic  spectrogram. Time-frequency ridges, the 2-D  analog of spectral peaks, are one feature that  is proposed. If non-oriented kernels are used  for the energy representation, then the ridge  tops can be identified, with zero-crossings in  the inner product of the gradient vector and the  direction of greatest downward curvature. If  oriented kernels are used, the method can be  generalized to give better orientation selectivity  (e.g., at intersecting ridges) at the cost of  poorer time-frequency locality. Many speech  examples are given showing the performance  for some traditionally difficult cases: semi-vowels and glides, nasalized vowels,  consonant-vowel transitions, female speech,  and imperfect transmission channels.",

        "Abstrak": "Control of machines that exhibit flexibility  becomes important when designers attempt  to push the state of the art with faster, lighter  machines. Three steps are necessary for the  control of a flexible planet. First, a good  model of the plant must exist. Second, a good  controller must be designed. Third, inputs to  the controller must be constructed using  knowledge of the system dynamic response.  There is a great deal of literature pertaining to  modeling and control but little dealing with the  shaping of system inputs. Chapter 2  examines two input shaping techniques  based on frequency domain analysis. The  first involves the use of the first deriviate of a  gaussian exponential as a driving function  template. The second, acasual filtering,  involves removal of energy from the driving  functions at the resonant frequencies of the  system. Chapter 3 presents a linear  programming technique for generating  vibration-reducing driving functions for  systems. Chapter 4 extends the results of the  previous chapter by developing a direct  solution to the new class of driving functions.  A detailed analysis of the new technique is  presented from five different perspectives and  several extensions are presented.  Chapter 5  verifies the theories of the previous two  chapters with hardware experiments.  Because the new technique resembles  common signal filtering, chapter 6 compares  the new approach to eleven standard filters.  The new technique will be shown to result in  less residual vibrations, have better  robustness to system parameter uncertainty,  and require less computation than other  currently used shaping techniques.",

Theories of argument structure are largely theories about how these additional arguments are introduced, but at present few such theories propose explicit mechanisms for deriving crosslinguistic variation in argument expression. This thesis develops a tightly constrained universal system of functional units and argues that crosslinguistic variation arises either from differences in the inventory of units that a language selects for or from the way a language groups the universal units into syntactic heads. The core system consists of three different types of causative heads, two different types of applicative heads and the external argument introducing head Voice (Kratzer 1994). The thesis shows that the properties of applicative constructions are such that they can only be predicted by a theory in which the external argument is also \"additional\", i.e. not a true argument of the verb.",

This paper offers a standard critique of those policies and also analyzes them in terms of the likelihood they will induce innovation in response to their requirements. The US proposal relaxes the hazardous waste handling requirements for cathode ray tubes and mercury containing equipment, with the intent that more of them will be recycled. However, the rule does not contain any requirement that recycling occur, and the economic incentives to do so are minimal. Technological innovation and diffusion of current technology are both unlikely responses to the proposed rule. In addition, the rule does not apply to many users and types of electronics equipment, thereby only addressing a very small portion of the overall electronics waste issue. The rule fails to consider other materials found in electronics equipment and issues regarding recyclability, recycled content, secondary markets, and materials substitution. Two of the EU proposed directives are much more comprehensive in their coverage of electronics waste. They require certain recycling targets to be met and mandate the elimination of some hazardous substances from electronics equipment. Diffusion and incremental innovation are likely responses, with perhaps radical innovation only as the targets become more stringent in future years. The directives require additional clarification regarding the types of electronics equipment covered, financing mechanisms, the structure of the recycling targets, the granting of exemptions, and the development of secondary markets. Portions of the two EU proposed directives may be challenged under World Trade Organization rules. An analysis shows that provisions in the directives could face some difficulty in obtaining exemptions. A growing disconnect between global trade rules and the making of environmental policy is examined. Finally, one additional proposed EU policy that would require manufacturers of electronics equipment to consider the life cycle environmental impacts of the equipment during its design and manufacture is analyzed. At present, innovation is an unlikely response to this directive, though the inclusion of specific performance requirements could substantially improve it. Suggested modifications are offered for each of the policies examined.",

        "Abstrak": "Pornography deserves special protections, it is often said, because it qualifies as speech; therefore, no matter what we think of it, we must afford it the protections that we extend to most speech, but don't extend to other actions. In response, it has been argued that the case is not so simple: one of the harms of pornography, it is claimed, is that it silences women's speech, thereby preventing women from deriving from speech the very benefits that warrant the special protections in the first place. This dissertation offers a way of making sense of the view that pornography silences women. In Chapter 1, I develop an account of silencing which, unlike other accounts of the same phenomenon, helps make clear why a speaker who is silenced is thereby deprived of the benefits that led us to place a special value on speech. In Chapter 2, I respond to an objection that purports to show that, even if women are silenced, pornography cannot be responsible: in fact, according to this objection, the responsibility for any instance of silencing cannot lie with any party other than the speaker and the audience involved. I show that this objection relies on an overly simplistic picture of what audiences can reasonably be required to do in a speech situation; I also offer an alternate picture, which leaves open the possibility that a speaker may be silenced in a context in which both she and her audience behave competently.(cont.) In Chapter 3, I consider a view about the way in which pornography contributes to the silencing - and more generally, to the subordination - of women. I argue that this view fails because it is too individualistic: it ignores how the social and political context in which the pornography is consumed helps determine whether it subordinates. I then make some suggestions about what a more satisfactory view would be. Though pornography is the principal case study throughout this dissertation, much of what I say generalizes to other forms of representation that set limits on what speakers are able to convey. The main aim of my discussion is to contribute to the philosophical and feminist understanding of communication, by showing how an individual's social role can constrain her possibilities as a speaker.",

Following the work of Johnson 1996, sharing structures are argued to exist using scope and binding facts in Gapping contexts. The role that sharing structures play in a wide variety of syntactic phenomena is then investigated. A new theory of Gapping is proposed, in which sharing structures (or Small-Conjunct structures, as they are traditionally referred to within the context of Gapping) play a central role. It is claimed that Gapping is a deletion operation which must be triggered by a specific syntactic environment - namely, a sharing structure with particular morpho-syntactic features. Sharing structures are then used to investigate the relationship between the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC) and A-movement. Novel evidence is presented which reveal that A-movement exhibits CSC effects.(cont.) It is shown that A-movement is similar to Quantifier Raising (QR) in the way that it obeys the CSC, and that both of these are unlike overt A'-movement. Finally, sharing structures are applied in the analysis of determiner sharing, a phenomenon first described by McCawley (1993), in which determiners on Noun Phrases (NPs) in initial conjuncts may be \"shared\" by corresponding, determinerless NPs in non-initial conjuncts, so long as a particular form of Gapping has taken place. Two previous analyses (Johnson 2000 and Lin 2000) are considered and revised, resulting in a new proposal regarding the syntax of Determiner Phrases (DPs), in which each determiner head (D) must be licensed by a functional head higher in the tree. It is argued that placing this new syntax of DPs in the context of sharing structures provides a simple account of the determiner sharing facts.",

        "Abstrak": "My dissertation consists of three essays in the Metaphysics of Modality: In \"A Puzzle about Truth and Singular Propositions,\" I consider two theses that seem to be true and then an argument for the conclusion that they form an inconsistent pair. One thesis is that a proposition that is singular with respect to a given object implies that the object exists. This is so because the proposition predicates something of the object. The other thesis is that some propositions are true with respect to possible worlds in which they do not exist. An example is the negation of the proposition that Socrates is wise. This proposition is true with respect to possible worlds in which Socrates does not exist, but it does not exist in those worlds. In \"Actualism, Ontological Dependence, and Possible Worlds,\" I consider Actualism, the doctrine that every possible object is an actual object. Plantinga has argued that the actualist is committed to the existence of unexemplified essences if he analyzes statements of modality by quantifying over possible worlds and over members of their domains. I argue that the actualist is committed to the existence of unexemplified essences even if he paraphrases statements of modality by quantifying only over possible worlds and actual objects. In \"Possibilism and the Nature of Actuality,\" I consider Possibilism, the doctrine that there are possible objects that are not actual objects.(cont.) Possibilism seems to be a coherent ontological doctrine. It is not Meinong's doctrine that there are objects of which it is true to say that there are no such objects. If one fails to distinguish between these two doctrines, then one's attempt to refute Possibilism might amount to an attack on a blatant contradiction. I illustrate this claim by arguing that the distinction between Possibilism and Meinong's doctrine has eluded Plantinga. I then consider the view that Possibilism is a consequence of Lewis's doctrine that 'actual' is an indexical term. I also argue that the sense in which Lewis said that 'actual' is indexical is an esoteric sense of the word, not a sense it ordinarily has.",

Technology is ever evolving, and the new must be an improvement upon the old; otherwise, there is no sense in adopting the new and unproven technology. For the commercialization of the fuel cell vehicle to be successful, it has to be competitive with the internal combustion vehicle in terms of policy parameters which influence the automobile's development and diffusion. These parameters are performance, environmental effects, and economics. A meaningful comparison considers these parameters. Thus the criteria chosen for the comparison are indicators of the parameters-energy efficiency, emissions, and cost to the consumer. A variety of fuels are chosen for each type of vehicle, and the full fuel cycle energy efficiency and emissions resulting from the extraction, production and consumption of these fuels are considered. This results in a comparison that takes into account the entire system associated with the use of fuels in a vehicle. The energy efficiency and emissions are estimated using a simple Reference Case, and a number of previous studies. The cost to the consumer for each type of vehicle is estimated using previous cost studies. Both the initial cost and the operating costs are included in the analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, considering the full fuel cycle, fuel cell vehicles are more energy efficient and emit fewer pollutants than internal combustion vehicles. However, the difference between the two are dampened by the inefficiencies and emissions associated with the extraction and production of the fuel. Even if fuel cell vehicles are mass-produced, they are still more expensive than conventional vehicles. Thus there is a tradeoff between improved efficiency and environmental performance, and cost. Fuel cell vehicles may possibly cost less than conventional automobiles if they last longer, and are priced on a per kilometer basis. Despite the higher cost, consumers may be willing to pay a premium for improved performance. Moreover, other considerations not within the scope of this thesis, such as other performance parameters and a vehicle support network, must be taken into account.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis can be summarized in the following two objectives: (i) to develop a new version of the Nuclear Stress Rule (NSR) which overcomes certain problems found with previous versions, and (ii) to explain the so-called preverbal focus position in Basque in terms of the new NSR and prosodic principles imposed on focused phrases. With respect to the NSR, I argue that certain generalizations about stress above the word level can be reduced to two basic syntactic properties of phrases: headedness and branchingness. The proposal is based on certain crucial insights found in previous work on the topic (Chomsky, Halle, and Lukoff 1956, Chomsky and Halle 1968, Liberman and Prince 1977, Halle and Vergnaud 1987, Cinque 1993, Zubizarreta 1998). The work reported in this thesis puts these insights together, resulting in a new version of the NSR, within the formalism of the metrical grid, which makes explicit reference to syntactic structure. With respect to the preverbal focus position in Basque, I argue, contra much previous work on the topic, that it is not a syntactically defined position. Rather, it is to be explained in terms of certain prosodic conditions imposed on focused phrases. More specifically, focused phrases need to have primary stress in the sentence.(cont. ) The analysis is based on insights about the relation between syntax and discourse found in Cinque 1993, Zubizarreta 1998 and Reinhart 1995. The basic idea is that, given certain indepedently motivated hypotheses about Basque syntax, the NSR proposed in this thesis predicts that, in many cases, sentence stress is on the preverbal constituent. Since focused phrases need to have sentence stress, it follows that they must be in the preverbal position. However, in certain cases, the analysis correctly predicts that the focused phrase is not the one preceding the verb, but one containing the verb. I argue that this provides further evidence in favor of this analysis, and against analyses in which the preverbal focus position is defined syntactlically.",

        "Abstrak": "My dissertation concerns the nature of linguistic understanding. A standard view about linguistic understanding is that it is a propositional knowledge state. The following is an instance of this view: given a speaker S and an expression a that means M, S understand a just in case S knows that a means M. I refer to this as the epistemic view of linguistic understanding. The epistemic view would appear to be a mere conceptual truth about linguistic understanding, since it is entailed by the following two claims that themselves seem to be mere conceptual truths: (i) S understands a iff S knows what a means, and-given that a means M-(ii) S knows what a means iff S knows that a means M. I argue, however, that this is not a mere conceptual truth. Contrary to the epistemic view, propositional knowledge of the meaning of a is not necessary for understanding a. I argue that linguistic understanding does not even require belief. My positive proposal is that our understanding of language is typically realized, at least in native speakers, as a perceptual capacity. Evidence from cognitive neuropsychology suggests that our perceptual experience of language comes to us already semantically interpreted. We perceive a speaker's utterance as having content, and it is by perceiving the speaker's utterances as having the right content that we understand what the speaker says. We count as understanding language (roughly) in virtue of having this capacity to understand what speakers say when they use language. This notion of perceiving an utterance as having content gets analyzed in terms of Dretske's account of representation in terms of a teleological notion of function: you perceive a speaker's utterance as having content when the utterance produces in you a perceptual state that has a certain function in your psychology.(cont.) I show how this view about the nature of linguistic understanding provides an attractive account of how identity claims can be semantically informative, as opposed to merely pragmatically informative, an account that avoids the standard difficulties for Fregean views that attempt to account for the informativeness of identity claims in terms of their semantics.",

        "Abstrak": "Extended producer responsibility is a business strategy whereby a firm assumes responsibility for the environmental impacts of a product throughout its entire lifecycle. By taking such responsibility, a firm realizes an incentive to design environmentally preferable products that are easier to recycle, reuse, or re-manufacture. Many extended producer responsibility strategies involve product take-back, whereby the producer can harvest residual value of the product at the end of its useful lifetime. This strategy is connected to sustainable development in that producers are taking responsibility for the products they are offering. Society is faced with many global environmental problems that threaten ecological stability and social wellbeing. Extended producer responsibility facilitates awareness of these problems and encourages the design of innovative products with minimal environmental impacts. This awareness is an important step toward the possibility of sustainable development. There are three requirements for successful differentiation of a product. First, consumers must be willing to pay for the new product. Second, credible information must be available regarding the product. Third, barriers must be erected to prevent competitors from imitating the product. A producer who attempts to satisfy these requirements is exhibiting rational economic behavior. Hence, this thesis asks whether firms that invest in sustainable product differentiation through extended producer responsibility are exhibiting rational economic behavior. Four products are examined in extensive detail. These include Xerox's Document Center 265, Interface's environmental flooring products including the Evergreen Lease, Kodak's single use camera, and Deep E. Co.' s environmental footwear. Each case study has shown evidence of rational economic behavior. However, Interface and Deep E. Co. have also displayed strong environmental propensities that seem to prohibit successful differentiation. Furthermore, two other requirements are found that are particularly important for extended producer responsibility. First, the producer must invest in an extensive R&D relationship with its suppliers. Second, to harvest residual value of the product, reverse logistics systems must be in place. The thesis concludes that regulation is not necessary for products such as those studied here. However, voluntary programs resembling EPA's Energy Star program may help in communicating the benefits of extended producer responsibility to other businesses.",

        "Abstrak": "Non-muscle cell contractility is critical for tissues to adopt shape changes. Although, the non-muscle myosin II holoenzyme (myosin) is a molecular motor that powers contraction of actin cytoskeleton networks, recent studies have questioned the importance of myosin motor activity cell and tissue shape changes. Here, combining the biochemical analysis of enzymatic and motile properties for purified myosin mutants with in vivo measurements of apical constriction for the same mutants, we show that in vivo constriction rate scales with myosin motor activity. We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the Drosophila regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro. The defect in the myosin motor activity in these mutants is evident in developing Drosophila embryos where tissue recoil following laser ablation is decreased compared to wild-type tissue. Overall, our data highlights that myosin activity is required for rapid cell contraction and tissue folding in developing Drosophila embryos.",

        "Abstrak": "Genotyping errors are well-known to impact the power and type I error rate in single marker tests of association. Genotyping errors that happen according to the same process in cases and controls are known as non-differential genotyping errors, whereas genotyping errors that occur with different processes in the cases and controls are known as differential genotype errors. For single marker tests, non-differential genotyping errors reduce power, while differential genotyping errors increase the type I error rate. However, little is known about the behavior of the new generation of rare variant tests of association in the presence of genotyping errors. In this manuscript we use a comprehensive simulation study to explore the effects of numerous factors on the type I error rate of rare variant tests of association in the presence of differential genotyping error. We find that increased sample size, decreased minor allele frequency, and an increased number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) included in the test all increase the type I error rate in the presence of differential genotyping errors. We also find that the greater the relative difference in case-control genotyping error rates the larger the type I error rate. Lastly, as is the case for single marker tests, genotyping errors classifying the common homozygote as the heterozygote inflate the type I error rate significantly more than errors classifying the heterozygote as the common homozygote. In general, our findings are in line with results from single marker tests. To ensure that type I error inflation does not occur when analyzing next-generation sequencing data careful consideration of study design (e.g. use of randomization), caution in meta-analysis and using publicly available controls, and the use of standard quality control metrics is critical.",

The density of states of all three molecules is also compared to photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra measured on thin films, and they exhibit a close agreement—a rigid energy-gap renormalization owing to intermolecular interactions in the thin films. In addition, it is shown that the low-lying unoccupied states of [C[subscript 60]]PCBM are all derived from the highest-occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals of fullerene C[subscript 60]. The functional side group in [C[subscript 60]]PCBM introduces a slight electron transfer to the fullerene cage, resulting in small decreases of both VIP and VEA.

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation develops approaches to rapidly detect malicious network traffic including packets sent by portscanners and network worms. The main hypothesis is that stochastic models capturing a host's particular connection-level behavior provide a good foundation for identifying malicious network activity in real-time. Using the models, the dissertation shows that a detection problem can be formulated as one of observing a particular \"trajectory\" of arriving packets and inferring from it the most likely classification for the given host's behavior. This stochastic approach enables us not only to estimate an algorithm's performance based on the measurable statistics of a host's traffic but also to balance the goals of promptness and accuracy in detecting malicious network activity. This dissertation presents three detection algorithms based on Wald's mathematical framework of sequential analysis. First, Threshold Random Walk (TRW) rapidly detects remote hosts performing a portscan to a target network. TRW is motivated by the empirically observed disparity between the frequency with which connections to newly visited local addresses are successful for benign hosts vs. for portscanners. Second, it presents a hybrid approach that accurately detects scanning worm infections quickly after the infected local host begins to engage in worm propagation.(cont.) Finally, it presents a targeting worm detection algorithm, Rate-Based Sequential Hypothesis Testing (RBS), that promptly identifies high-fan-out behavior by hosts (e.g., targeting worms) based on the rate at which the hosts initiate connections to new destinations. RBS is built on an empirically-driven probability model that captures benign network characteristics. It then presents RBS+TRW, a unified framework for detecting fast-propagating worms independently of their target discovery strategy. All these schemes have been implemented and evaluated using real packet traces collected from multiple network vantage points.",

This thesis formalizes the task of comparative  analysis and presents two solution  techniques: differential qualitative (DQ)  analysis and exaggeration.

This thesis explains  the theoretical basis for each technique,  describes how they are implemented, and  discusses the difference between the two.  DQ analysis is sound; it never generates an  incorrect answer to a comparative analysis  question.

The  particular tasks used to assess motor  learning are loaded and unloaded free arm  movement, and the thesis includes work on  rigid body load estimation, arm model  estimation, optimal filtering for model  parameter estimation, and trajectory learning  from practice.

Improving the  performance of parameter estimation  algorithms used in learning involves  knowledge of the measurement noise  characteristics, as is shown in the derivation  of optimal filters. Using trajectory errors to  correct commands requires knowledge of  how command errors are transformed into  performance errors, i.e., an accurate model of  the dynamics of the controlled system, as is  demonstrated in the trajectory learning work.

The  general parts assembly operation involves the  removal of alignment errors within some  tolerance and without damaging the parts.  Two methods for eliminating alignment errors  are discussed: a priori suppression and  measurement and removal. Both methods  are studied with the more novel measurement  and removal technique being studied in  greater detail. During the study of this  technique, a fast and accurate six degree-of-freedom position sensor based on a light-stripe vision technique was developed.  Specifications for the sensor were derived  from an assembly-system error analysis.  Studies on extracting accurate information  from the sensor by optimally reducing  redundant information, filtering quantization  noise, and careful calibration procedures  were performed. Prototype assembly systems  for both error elimination techniques were  implemented and used to assemble several  products. The assembly system based on the  a priori suppression technique uses a  number of mechanical assembly tools and  software systems which extend the  capabilities of industrial robots. The need for  the tools was determined through an  assembly task analysis of several consumer  and automotive products. The assembly  system based on the measurement and  removal technique used the six degree-of-freedom position sensor to measure part  misalignments.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the generality and practical value of a probabilistic (in particular, Bayesian) approach to this problem, particularly in the context of Computer Vision. In this approach, the prior knowledge about the solution is expressed in the form of a Gibbsian probability distribution on the space of all possible functions, so that the reconstruction task is formulated as an estimation problem. Our main contributions are the following: (1) We introduce the use of specific error criteria for the design of the optimal Bayesian estimators for several classes of problems, and propose a general (Monte Carlo) procedure for approximating them. This new approach leads to a substantial improvement over the existing schemes, both regarding the quality of the results (particularly for low signal to noise ratios) and the computational efficiency. (2) We apply the Bayesian appraoch to the solution of several problems, some of which are formulated and solved in these terms for the first time. Specifically, these applications are: teh reconstruction of piecewise constant surfaces from sparse and noisy observationsl; the reconstruction of depth from stereoscopic pairs of images and the formation of perceptual clusters. (3) For each one of these applications, we develop fast, deterministic algorithms that approximate the optimal estimators, and illustrate their performance on both synthetic and real data. (4) We propose a new method, based on the analysis of the residual process, for estimating the parameters of the probabilistic models directly from the noisy observations. This scheme leads to an algorithm, which has no free parameters, for the restoration of piecewise uniform images. (5) We analyze the implementation of the algorithms that we develop in non-conventional hardware, such as massively parallel digital machines, and analog and hybrid networks.",

These results  suggest that Local Rotational Symmetries  provide a more robustly computable and  perceptually accurate description of round  regions than previous proposed  representations. In the course of developing  this representation, it has been necessary to  modify the way both Smoothed Local  Symmetries and Local Rotational Symmetries  are computed. First, grey-scale image  smoothing proves to be better than boundary  smoothing for creating representations at  multiple scales of resolution, because it is  more robust and it allows qualitative changes  in representations between scales. Secondly,  it is proposed that shape representations at  different scales of resolution be explicitly  related, so that information can be passed  between scales and computation at each  scale can be kept local.

At  discrete moments of time the cells can  change from one state to another as a  function of the states of the cell and its  neighbors. Thus on a global basis, the  collection of cells is characterized by some  type of behavior. The goal of this investigation  was to determine just how simple the  individual cells could be while the global  behavior achieved some specified criterion of  complexity ??ually the ability to perform a  computation or to reproduce some pattern.

        "Abstrak": "We have developed a compiler for the  lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as  SCHEME. The compiler knows relatively little  about specific data manipulation primitives  such as arithmetic operators, but  concentrates on general issues of  environment and control. Rather than having  specialized knowledge about a large variety of  control and environment constructs, the  compiler handles only a small basis set  which reflects the semantics of lambda-calculus. All of the traditional imperative  constructs, such as sequencing, assignment,  looping, GOTO, as well as many standard  LISP constructs such as AND, OR, and  COND, are expressed in macros in terms of  the applicative basis set. A small number of  optimization techniques, coupled with the  treatment of function calls as GOTO  statements, serve to produce code as good  as that produced by more traditional  compilers. The macro approach enables  speedy implementation of new constructs as  desired without sacrificing efficiency in the  generated code. A fair amount of analysis is  devoted to determining whether environments  may be stack-allocated or must be heap-allocated. Heap-allocated environments are  necessary in general because SCHEME  (unlike Algol 60 and Algol 68, for example)  allows procedures with free lexically scoped  variables to be returned as the values of other  procedures; the Algol stack-allocation  environment strategy does not suffice. The  methods used here indicate that a heap-allocating generalization of the \"display\"  technique leads to an efficient implementation  of such \"upward funargs\". Moreover, compile-time optimization and analysis can eliminate  many \"funargs\" entirely, and so far fewer  environment structures need be allocated at  run time than might be expected. A subset of  SCHEME (rather than triples, for example)  serves as the representation intermediate  between the optimized SCHEME code and the  final output code; code is expressed in this  subset in the so-called continuation-passing  style. As a subset of SCHEME, it enjoys the  same theoretical properties; one could even  apply the same optimizer used on the input  code to the intermediate code. However, the  subset is so chosen that all temporary  quantities are made manifest as variables,  and no control stack is needed to evaluate it.  As a result, this apparently applicative  representation admits an imperative  interpretation which permits easy transcription  to final imperative machine code. These  qualities suggest that an applicative language  like SCHEME is a better candidate for an  UNCOL than the more imperative candidates  proposed to date.",

This  functional topology is then parsed by a  grammar for common circuit functions.  Ambiguities are introduced into the analysis  by the approximate qualitative nature of the  analysis. For example, there are often several  possible mechanisms which might describe  the circuit's function. These are  disambiguated by teleological analysis. The  requirement that each component be  assigned an appropriate purpose in the  functional topology imposes a severe  constraint which eliminates all the  ambiguities. Since both analyses are based  on heuristics, the chosen mechanism is a  rationalization of how the circuit functions, and  does not guarantee that the circuit actually  does function. This type of coarse  understanding of circuits is useful for  analysis, design and troubleshooting.",

Substitution is used to maintain all knowledge  in terms of these canonical expressions. A  partial order on designators, termed the  better-name relation, is used in the choice of  canonical expressions. It is shown that with  an appropriate better-name relation an  important engineering reasoning technique,  propagation of constraints, can be  implemented as a special case of this  substitution process. Special purpose  algebraic simplification procedures are  embedded such that they interact effectively  with the equality system. An electrical circuit  analysis system is developed which relies  upon constraint propagation and algebraic  simplification as primary reasoning  techniques. The reasoning is guided by a  better-name relation in which referentially  transparent terms are preferred to referentially  opaque ones. Multiple description of  subcircuits are shown to interact strongly with  the reasoning mechanism.",

        "Abstrak": "The Ion Cyclotron RF Transmitter System (ICRF) at Alcator C-Mod comprises four separate transmitters each capable of driving 2 MW of power into plasma loads. Four separate transmission lines guide RF power into three antennas, each mounted in a separate horizontal port, in the C-Mod Tokamak. Protection for the antennas, matching elements and transmission line is accomplished by two unique but interdependent subsystems encompassed by the ICRF Fault System. The Antenna Protection System evaluates antenna phasing and voltage, sets fault thresholds, generates fault signals, and passes fault information to the Master Fault Processor. During operation, the Master Fault Processor is responsible for detecting hazards along the transmission line, generating faults, processing faults from the Antenna Protection System, terminating RF drive and extinguishing faults within 10 mus. In addition, the system controls various delays and sets the boundaries for RF retries. The ICRF Control System provides amplitude regulation for all antennas and phase control for a four-strap antenna. We are modifying some of the fault processing components and control elements of these systems in an effort to improve reliability and serviceability, and increase flexibility. This upgrade will reduce wired interconnections, add remote features to improve access to key operating parameters, improve RF isolation with new switching components, simplify phase control, and expand the RF regulation system to an active control regime whereby plasma parameters may become direct feedback elements for RF regulation. Details of the proposed upgrade to the system will be presented, and implementation of any new technological tools will be discussed.",

To adjust the X gene dosage between genders, female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) that requires both Rlim (also known as Rnf12) and the long non-coding RNA Xist. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate functions of Rlim on the temporal regulation of iXCI and Xist. Our results reveal crucial roles of Rlim for the maintenance of high Xist RNA levels, Xist clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial Xist expression appears Rlim-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos.",

The result is initial fields that are consistent with observations, complex geometry and dynamics, and that can simulate the evolution of ocean processes without large spurious initial transients. A class of constrained weighted least squares optimizations is defined to best fit first-guess velocities while satisfying the complex bathymetry, coastline and divergence strong constraints. A weak constraint towards the minimum inter-island transports that are in accord with the first-guess velocities provides important velocity corrections in complex archipelagos. In the optimization weights, the minimum distance and vertical area between pairs of coasts are computed using a Fast Marching Method. Additional information on velocity and transports are included as strong or weak constraints. We apply our methodology around the Hawaiian islands of Kauai/Niihau, in the Taiwan/Kuroshio region and in the Philippines Archipelago. Comparisons with other common initialization strategies, among hindcasts from these initial conditions (ICs), and with independent in situ observations show that our optimization corrects transports, satisfies boundary conditions and redirects currents. Differences between the hindcasts from these different ICs are found to grow for at least 2–3 weeks. When compared to independent in situ observations, simulations from our optimized ICs are shown to have the smallest errors.",

Their applications range from platforms to increase the efficiency of anchorage-dependent cell culture to building blocks to loading cells in heterogeneous structures to clonal-population growth monitoring to cell sorting. Although useful, currently available cell-adhesive particles can accommodate only homogeneous cell culture. Here, we report the design of anisotropic hydrogel microparticles with tunable cell-adhesive regions as first step toward micropatterned cell cultures on particles. We employed stop flow lithography (SFL), the coupling reaction between amine and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and streptavidin–biotin chemistry to adjust the localization of conjugated collagen and poly-l-lysine on the surface of microscale particles. Using the new particles, we demonstrate the attachment and formation of tight junctions between brain endothelial cells. We also demonstrate the geometric patterning of breast cancer cells on particles with heterogeneous collagen coatings. This new approach avoids the exposure of cells to potentially toxic photoinitiators and ultraviolet light and decouples in time the microparticle synthesis and the cell culture steps to take advantage of the most recent advances in cell patterning available for traditional culture substrates.",

        "Abstrak": "This paper investigates three different technologies for solving a planning and scheduling problem of deploying multiple robots in a retirement home environment to assist elderly residents. The models proposed make use of standard techniques and solvers developed in AI planning and scheduling, with two primary motivations. First, to find a planning and scheduling solution that we can deploy in our real-world application. Second, to evaluate planning and scheduling technology in terms of the ``model-and-solve'' functionality that forms a major research goal in both domain-independent planning and constraint programming. Seven variations of our application are studied using the following three technologies: PDDL-based planning, time-line planning and scheduling, and constraint-based scheduling. The variations address specific aspects of the problem that we believe can impact the performance of the technologies while also representing reasonable abstractions of the real world application. We evaluate the capabilities of each technology and conclude that a constraint-based scheduling approach, specifically a decomposition using constraint programming, provides the most promising results for our application. PDDL-based planning is able to find mostly low quality solutions while the timeline approach was unable to model the full problem without alterations to the solver code, thus moving away from the model-and-solve paradigm. It would be misleading to conclude that constraint programming is ``better'' than PDDL-based planning in a general sense, both because we have examined a single application and because the approaches make different assumptions about the knowledge one is allowed to embed in a model. Nonetheless, we believe our investigation is valuable for AI planning and scheduling researchers as it highlights these different modelling assumptions and provides insight into avenues for the application of AI planning and scheduling for similar robotics problems. In particular, as constraint programming has not been widely applied to robot planning and scheduling in the literature, our results suggest significant untapped potential in doing so.",

A tensile output bar is used to measure the tensile force acting on the specimen boundaries. A high speed camera system is employed to measure the displacement history at the specimen level through planar digital image correlation. The output bar is positioned on top of the input bar. As a result, the valid experiment duration of the proposed system is twice as long as that of conventional Kolsky systems. It therefore facilitates the execution of intermediate strain rate (~100/s) experiments without increasing total system length. Numerical simulations are carried out to assess the effect of spurious bending effects that are introduced through the eccentricity of the input and output bar axes.

Using a principal agent model, I addressed theoretically the optimal tradeoff between the inefficient risk sharing and a high incentive, to conclude that the optimal CEO pay performance level should be negatively related to the level of idiosyncratic (undiversifiable) risk in the firm. I empirically tested the hypothesis and found strong support. The second paper is on the intermediation of labor income risk. From the perspective of optimal risk sharing, it looks at the recent trend of the rise intermediated labor force and its relationship with the riskness of human capital. I built an overlapping generations model to address the following issues: 1) what types of laborers get to work in conventional firms versus in labor intermediation firms? 2) how will the labor intermediation business be endogenously determined in equilibrium? 3) what effect does labor intermediation have on the ex ante decision of laborers to acquire specialized human capital? The third paper is a joint work with Stewart Myers. Empirical researches document that more developed financial systems seem to have higher level of idiosyncratic risk. Also, in the United States, idiosyncratic risk level goes up as the level of economic activity increases. This paper uses the framework developed in Myers (2000 JF) to explain such phenomena. The fourth paper is a joint work with Andrew Lo. It is on data-mining, and its role in explaining the financial anomalies documented in the literature. We developed a series of statistical and econometric methodologies to differentiate spurious statistical artifact from a real anomaly. We also give an extensive literature review of the landscape of the financial anomalies.",

Credit unions provide a setting with large variation in audit quality, ranging from a \"self audit\" to an independent CPA audit. I find credit unions select higher audit quality if faced with higher business risk, size and agency costs. Audit quality is inversely associated with the probability of earnings management but is not associated with other forms of financial statement management. However, audit quality is not associated with an increased likelihood of financial distress or failure. My findings suggest that other forms of monitoring, such as regulatory examinations, may substitute for low audit quality. Accordingly, mandating higher audit quality alone may not have a substantial effect on the quality of reported financial results or the likelihood of financial distress. The second paper examines performance evaluation in the credit union setting. Using data from a moderate-sized credit union, the essay employs a case-study approach to examine the role of annual budgeting, pricing of services, and compensation.",

Measures of Merit are developed and applied to the case study. The resulting requirements space and methods to visualize and explore it in a decision making context are presented and discussed Lastly, a framework is proposed that would facilitate the concurrent consideration of requirements and effectiveness analyses with design and technology forecasting to create a Unified Tradeoff Environment that would provide decision makers with pertinent information to facilitate better informed requirements derivation and design selection.",

        "Abstrak": "Graphene, a single sheet of carbon atoms, may provide the foundation for a new class of highly permeable membranes for water purification and desalination. Though atomically thin, graphene exhibits both exceptional mechanical strength and imperviousness to atoms as small as helium. High-density, subnanometer pores within graphene have the potential for ultra-fast water permeance and high solute rejection as the atomic thinness provides little resistance to flow yet sterically hinders the transport of solutes larger than the pores. The resulting two-dimensional, nanoporous membrane is predicted to exhibit orders-of-magnitude permeability and selectivity enhancement over existing separation membranes for processes such as desalination of sea or brackish water, water softening, or nanofiltration. Herein, I will report our work to overcome the key challenges to the experimental realization of graphene membranes. I will describe methods to 1) fabricate a large area monolayer graphene membrane bonded to a porous polymer support, 2) create controlled, subnanometer pores through ion bombardment followed by chemical oxidation, and 3) seal leaks in the composite membrane by covering intrinsic graphene defects with hafnium oxide via atomic layer deposition and large cracks with an impermeable polymer through interfacial polymerization. We found the resulting graphene membrane to exhibit selective transport behavior consistent with recent theoretical models. At short chemical oxidation times, positively charged cations selectively permeated across the membrane over negatively charged anions, while at long chemical oxidation times small salts diffused across the membrane preferentially over larger organic dyes. Under forward osmosis, the membrane filtered from water a 0.8 nm-sized multivalent salt with a rejection rate of 67% and a 500 Da organic dye with a rejection rate of ~ 85% while exhibiting a water permeability in agreement with the analytical models. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental transport behavior suggests that, as predicted, nanoporous monolayer graphene will exhibit high permeance water filtration. While further optimization of membrane fabrication and pore creation processes will be required, our work significantly advances the field in this direction by developing procedures to probe transport, reporting the first experimental evidence of ionic and small molecule selectivity, and measuring water flux through nanoporous graphene membranes.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis we consider three combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, we study packing and scheduling questions of relevance in several areas of operations research, including interconnection networks and switch scheduling, VLSI design, and processor scheduling. The first chapter studies a natural edge-coloring question arising from the problem of scheduling packets through an interconnection network. The theoretical model we consider can be seen as a weighted extension of Konig's theorem that states that the minimum number of colors needed to color all edges of a bipartite graph equals the maximum vertex degree. For the weighted generalization, a longstanding open question is to determine the minimum number of colors as a function of n, the maximum total weight adjacent to any vertex. Our main contribution is to show that 2.557n + o(n) colors are sufficient, improving upon earlier work. In the second chapter, we consider the following variant of the classical bin-packing problem: Place a given list of rectangles into the minimum number of unit square bins. In the restricted case where all rectangles are squares, we design an algorithm with an asymptotic performance guarantee arbitrarily close to optimal. In the general case, we give an algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution, provided it is allowed to use slightly larger bins. Moreover, we extend these algorithmic ideas to handle a number of multidimensional packing problems, obtaining best-known results for several of these.(cont.) Finally, in the third chapter, we discuss a standard sequencing problem, namely, scheduling precedence-constrained jobs on a single machine to minimize the sum of weighted completion times. We look at the problem from a polyhedral perspective, obtaining, as one of our main results, a generalization of a classical result by Sidney. This new insight allows us to reason that all known 2-approximation algorithms behave similarly. Furthermore, we present a new integer programming model that suggests a strong connection between the scheduling problem and the vertex cover problem.",

        "Abstrak": "The thesis explores a puzzle in technological capability development: many firms in China follow the \"normal\" way of technological capability development suggested by the existing literature but have not made much progress, while some firms that deviate from the \"normal\" way have made impressive progress. The thesis uses a multiple-case replication design to identify the key factors and mechanisms that affect technological capability development in China. Six cases are studied, each of which is treated as an independent experiment. The study does not follow any specific theory of technological capability development in order for conceptual insights to emerge. The study finds that technological capability development in the 6 firms studied is affected by three groups of factors-R&D characteristics, organizational conditions, and environmental conditions, and that these three groups of factors also form a nested relationship. First, technological capability development is directly influenced by R&D characteristics such as the timing of investing in R&D, level of R&D, human resources in R&D, collaboration with the knowledge frontier, and focus of R&D. R&D with the characteristics of early start, high level of investment, high quality human resource, deep collaboration with the knowledge frontier, and focusing more on knowledge intensive technology are more likely to lead to the development of proprietary technology. Second, characteristics of R&D are directly affected by organizational conditions such as urgency, confidence and resources in developing proprietary technology. High urgency and high confidence are more likely to lead to R&D characteristics more conducive for technological capability development.(cont.) Third, organizational conditions for technological capability development are directly affected by environmental conditions such as MNEs' policy of technology transfer, MNEs' policy of engagement in the local market, mechanism of industrial coordination in technology development, and mechanism of industrial coordination in market access. Low technology transfer policy of MNEs is more likely to lead to high urgency for proprietary technology development, while high technology transfer policy of MNEs is less likely to lead to high urgency for proprietary technology development. Decentralized coordination is less likely to help firms in developing countries to develop the confidence to develop proprietary technology than certain kind of centralized coordination. It is also less likely for firms in developing countries to generate the resources needed to develop proprietary technology if MNEs are willing to transfer technology and have a policy of deep engagement in the local market, and if the industrial coordination mechanisms in both technology development and market access are decentralized. The TV set firms are less innovative than the telecom equipment firms because they have less conducive R&D characteristics, organizational conditions, and environmental conditions for technological capability development. The findings of this study offer insights and suggest a new framework for the understanding of technological capability development for firms in China, and possibly in other developing countries ...",

        "Abstrak": "At the close of 2016, the United States finds itself deeply fractured, caught between clinging to a nostalgic past and pushing for progressive possibility. As we stand divided, a set of emerging great challenges threaten to rapidly change the world as we know. At such a juncture, I argue that the practice of imagination can help us to break out of habitual thinking and routine practice to see our challenges, and ourselves within them, more fully and clearly. By imagining alternative futures, and communicating them to a broader audience through fiction, I propose we may better understand, collectively, how to enact our agency in the present to address these challenges head-on. In this thesis, I argue for the practice of imagination through the lenses of three great challenges that we face as a nation: politics, the Anthropocene, and a culture of white supremacy. In an effort to identify and bridge the divides that exist within our current political and cultural moment, I propose a 'rural futurism' that centers the experiences, settings, and lives of rural America in imagined futures. I then operationalize the concept of 'rural futurism' on two levels; 1) the realizable potential of local democratic institutions, the rural electric cooperatives, as sites for democratic discourse and self-determination, and 2) speculative futures, communicated through fictional narratives, as a tool for developing critical consciousness in addressing the three great challenges imperative to re-imagining America. I present eight speculative fiction stories of alternative rural futures set in the American south to 'test' the concept of 'rural futurism' as a tool for addressing these challenges. The stories were reviewed by a focus group of southern writers and organizers, who provide the analysis, as well as my personal evaluation, of the stories effectiveness in addressing the challenges described and their resonance with the experience and context of the rural American south.",

The original Si wafer and the relaxed SiGe buffer are subsequently removed, thereby transferring a strained-Si layer directly to Si substrate without intermediate SiGe or oxide layers. Complete removal of Ge from the structure was confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy as well as secondary ion mass spectrometry. A plan-view transmission electron microscopy study of the strained-Si/Si interface reveals that the lattice-mismatch between the layers is accommodated by an orthogonal array of edge dislocations. This misfit dislocation array, which forms upon bonding, is geometrically necessary and has an average spacing of approximately 40nm, in excellent agreement with established dislocation theory. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a chemically homogeneous, yet lattice-mismatched, interface.",

Ordering cost includes both a fixed cost and a variable cost proportional to the amount ordered. The objective is to maximize expected discounted, or expected average profit over the infinite planning horizon. We show that a stationary (s,S,p) policy is optimal for both the discounted and average profit models with general demand functions.

The  inefficiency of the classical Lagrangian  formulation is well known, and this has led  researchers to seek alternative methods.  Several authors have developed a highly  efficient formulation of manipulator dynamics  based on the Newton-Euler equations, and  there may be some confusion as to the  source of this efficiency. This paper shows  that there is in fact no fundamental difference  in computational efficiency between  Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations.  The efficiency of the above-mentioned  Newton-Euler formulation is due to two  factors: the recursive structure of the  computation and the representation chosen of  the rotational dynamics. Both of these factors  can be achieved in the Lagrangian  formulation, resulting in an algorithm identical  to the Newton-Euler formulation. Recursive  Lagrangian dynamics has been discussed  previously by Hollerbach. This paper takes the  final step by comparing in detail the  representations that have been used for  rotational dynamics and showing that with a  proper choice of representation the  Lagrangian formulation is indeed equivalent  to the Newton-Euler formulation.",

This approach to problem  solving offers the promise of increased  performance and provides a useful medium  for exploring and developing new problem-solving techniques. We present a framework  called the contract net that specifies  communication and control in a distributed  problem solver. Task distribution is viewed as  an interactive process, a discussion carried  on between a node with a task to be executed  and a group of nodes that may be able to  execute the task. We describe the kinds of  information that must be passed between  nodes during the discussion in order to obtain  effective problem-solving behavior. This  discussion is the origin of the negotiation  metaphor: Task distribution is viewed as a  form of contract negotiation. We emphasize  that protocols for distributed problem solving  should help determine the content of the  information transmitted, rather than simply  provide a means of sending bits from one  node to another. The use of the contract net  framework is demonstrated in the solution of  a simulated problem in area surveillance, of  the sort encountered in ship or air traffic  control. We discuss the mode of operation of  a distributed sensing system, a network of  nodes extending throughout a relatively large  geographic area, whose primary aim is the  formation of a dynamic map of traffic in the  area. From the results of this preliminary  study we abstract features of the framework  applicable to problem solving in general,  examining in particular transfer of control.  Comparisons with PLANNER, CONNIVER,  HEARSAY-II, and PUP6 are used to  demonstrate that negotiation ??e two-way  transfer of information ?? a natural extension  to the transfer of control mechanisms used in  earlier problem-solving systems.",

We present the actor  model of computation as being appropriate  for parallel systems, since it organizes  knowledge as active objects acting  independently, and communicating by  message passing. We describe the parallel  constructs in our experimental actor  interpreter Act 1. Futures create concurrency,  by dynamically allocating processing  resources much as Lisp dynamically  allocates passive storage. Serializers restrict  concurrency by constraining the order in which  events take place, and have changeable local  state. Using the actor model allows  parallelism and synchronization to be  implemented transparently, so that parallel or  synchronized resources can be used as  easily as their serial counterparts.",

Three key ideas in current  artificial intelligence theories of engineering  problem solving are: Abstraction ??ing a  simplified view of the problem to guide the  problem solving process. Inspection ??roblem solving by recognizing the form  (\"plan\") of a solution. Debugging ??ncremental modification of an almost  satisfactory solution to a more satisfactory  one. These three techniques are typically  used together in a paradigm which we call  AID (for Abstraction, Inspection, Debugging):  First an abstract model of the problem is  constructed in which some important details  are not intentionally omitted. In this simplified  view inspection methods are more likely to  succeed, yielding the initial form of a solution.  Further details of the problem are then added  one at a time with corresponding incremental  modifications to the solution. This paper  states the goals and milestones of the  remaining three years of a five year research  project to study the fundamental principles  underlying the design and construction of  large software systems and to demonstrate  the feasibility of a computer aided design tool  for this purpose, called the programmer's  apprentice.",

In particular, algorithms  that are expressed as compositions of  functions operating on series/vectors/streams  of data elements are much easier to  understand and modify than equivalent  algorithms expressed as loops.  Unfortunately, many programmers hesitate to  use series expressions, because they are  typically implemented very inefficiently- the  prime source of inefficiency being the creation  of intermediate series objects.  A restricted class of series expressions,  obviously synchronizable series expressions,  is defined which can be evaluated very  efficiently. At the cost of introducing  restrictions which place modest limits on the  series expressions which can be written, the  restrictions guarantee that the creation of  intermediate series objects is never  necessary. This makes it possible to  automatically convert obviously  synchronizable series expressions into highly  efficient loops using straightforward  algorithms.",

Immobilization of either the capture antibodies or the protein samples on solid supports has severe drawbacks. Denaturation of the immobilized proteins as well as inconsistent orientation of antibodies/ligands on the arrays can lead to erroneous results. This has prompted a number of studies to address these challenges by immobilizing proteins on biocompatible surfaces, which has met with limited success. Our strategy relates to a multiplexed, sensitive and high-throughput method for the screening quantification of intracellular signalling proteins from a complex mixture of proteins. \r\n\r\nEach signalling protein to be monitored has its capture moiety linked to a specific oligo â€˜tag’. The array involves the oligonucleotide hybridization-directed localization and identification of different signalling proteins simultaneously, in a rapid and easy manner. Antibodies have been used as the capture moieties for specific identification of each signaling protein. The method involves covalently partnering each antibody/protein molecule with a unique DNA or DNA derivatives oligonucleotide tag that directs the antibody to a unique site on the microarray due to specific hybridization with a complementary tag-probe on the array. Particular surface modifications and optimal conditions allowed high signal to noise ratio which is essential to the success of this approach.",

Such applications arise in recommender systems, equipment maintenance, medical informatics, and in other domains. Our formalization of sequential event prediction draws on ideas from supervised ranking. We show how specific choices within this approach lead to different sequential event prediction problems and algorithms. In recommender system applications, the observed sequence of events depends on user choices, which may be influenced by the recommendations, which are themselves tailored to the user’s choices. This leads to sequential event prediction algorithms involving a non-convex optimization problem. We apply our approach to an online grocery store recommender system, email recipient recommendation, and a novel application in the health event prediction domain.",

Attempts to assure this preservation during acute phases of trauma, burn or sepsis have relied on treatments which appear to maintain the clinical picture of the \"fed state\" either orally or parenterally (\"hyperalimentation\"). Recognizing the importance of rapid fat mobilization and the favorable effects of starvation ketosis during periods of severe negative caloric balance, the efficiency of a limited, carbohydrate free alimentation was tested. Based on a metabolic fuel regulatory system that integrates carbohydrate, amino acid and fat metabolism 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg/day of protein was administered orally or intravenously. This regime does not appreciably impede fat mobilization as does comparable intake of carbohydrate. The ingested or infused amino acids need therefore not be expended primarily to support energy production, but can replenish the amino acid pools which sustain protein synthesis. Losses in lean body mass were prevented in obese patients undergoing prolonged periods of acute weight reduction and considerably reduced or even suppress losses in patients supported only by peripheral intravenous infusions. These investigations, hopefully, will provide improvements in nutritional therapies designed at reducing protein catabolism during periods of negative caloric balance.",

        "Abstrak": "The problem of automatic face recognition is  to visually identify a person in an input image.  This task is performed by matching the input  face against the faces of known people in a  database of faces. Most existing work in face  recognition has limited the scope of the  problem, however, by dealing primarily with  frontal views, neutral expressions, and fixed  lighting conditions. To help generalize  existing face recognition systems, we look at  the problem of recognizing faces under a  range of viewpoints. In particular, we consider  two cases of this problem: (i) many example  views are available of each person, and (ii)  only one view is available per person,  perhaps a driver's license or passport  photograph. Ideally, we would like to address  these two cases using a simple view-based  approach, where a person is represented in  the database by using a number of views on  the viewing sphere. While the view-based  approach is consistent with case (i), for case  (ii) we need to augment the single real view of  each person with synthetic views from other  viewpoints, views we call 'virtual views'. Virtual  views are generated using prior knowledge of  face rotation, knowledge that is 'learned' from  images of prototype faces. This prior  knowledge is used to effectively rotate in  depth the single real view available of each  person. In this thesis, I present the view-based face recognizer, techniques for  synthesizing virtual views, and experimental  results using real and virtual views in the  recognizer.",

Most studies of anthropogenic Pb in the ocean have focused on the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and the impact of anthropogenic Pb inputs to the Indian Ocean and processes controlling the distribution of Pb in the Indian Ocean are poorly known. This study presents the Pb and Pb isotopic composition (²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb, ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb) of 11 deep stations from the Indian Ocean Japanese GEOTRACES cruise (KH-09-5), from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea to the Southern Ocean (62°S). The Pb isotope ratios of the Indian Ocean range 1.140–1.190 for ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb and 2.417–2.468 for ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb, with lower ratios appearing in the shallow waters of the northern Indian Ocean and higher ratios appearing in the deep layers of the Southern Ocean. This result agrees with a previous study on Pb concentrations (Echegoyen et al., 2014) showing that the Indian Ocean, particularly its northern part, is largely perturbed by anthropogenic Pb inputs. ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb and ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb of the Indian sector Southern Ocean are still lower than natural Pb, showing this region was also affected by anthropogenic Pb. Anomalously low or high ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb and ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb were observed in the thermocline and shallow waters of the southern Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, which are ascribed to water mass distribution (e.g., Subantarctic Mode Water) and evolving Pb isotope ratios of this region as dominant anthropogenic Pb sources change. ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb and ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb in the Bay of Bengal are higher than those in the Arabian Sea, which might be the result of the anthropogenic Pb inputs from different provenance or seawater exchanging Pb isotopes with natural particles derived from rivers and/or sediments at the basin boundaries.",

The first part of this thesis project has a diagnostic purpose where the architect investigates historically and empirically the physical structure as well as the users' perceived imagery of the examined space. The second part uses the diagnosis' findings as a mapping device for the application of specific digital media, deemed appropriate for the task, and the orchestration of time-related events and information flows. The goal of this thesis, which focuses solely on public spaces for the extent of this research, is twofold. On a design level, it seeks to increase the quality of space and its potential to communicate with the users through a synergic, adaptive approach. On a research level, it seeks to bring together three diverse but not distant disciplines, those of architecture, cognitive psychology and information technology, suggesting a multi-disciplinary avenue for a retrospective design inquiry.",

This thesis proposes the integration of organizational strategy and capital programming to produce an efficient infrastructure portfolio able to be financially managed by the owner agency. The strategic capital programming process aims to enable the owner agency to base investment decisions on prior agency performance, long-term agency goals, and realistic analyses of market trends. The iterative process incorporates six core steps: 1) an audit of the agency's past performance, 2) a strategic assessment of the agency's goals and market environment concluding with the development of a corresponding list of potential capital projects, 3) the compilation of a baseline resource profile of the portfolio of projects, 4) an iterative portfolio analysis of the capital projects using schedule, scope, delivery method, and financing as variables, 5) the choice of a capital program that most closely fits agency resource constraints and strategic goals, and 6) program execution, performance tracking, and feedback. There are three major advantages to implementing a capital programming process that is focused on achieving strategic agency goals through the use of performance analysis and variable project delivery strategies. The process results in an effective and efficient long-term infrastructure investment strategy. Through the use of the process, the agency enables the achievement of their goals rather than hindering them with poor management methods. Finally, the agency can satisfy public demand by becoming more accountable for their investment of funds and strategic decision-making due to increased stakeholder participation and market analysis in the programming process. This thesis presents a detailed description and analysis of a strategic capital programming model and its applicability to government agencies. A case study of the Massachusetts Port Authority compares the proposed process to capital programming processes currently in use in advanced government agencies. The case study validates the inclusion of agency audit and strategic programming processes in capital programming and establishes the need for a new standard of market- and performance- oriented decision-making incorporating increased communication and feedback within the organization.",

        "Abstrak": "We develop various algorithms for solving mixed integer-quadratic problems. These problems exhibit exponential complexity resulting from the presence of integer variables. Traditional approaches that apply in pure integer programming are not very helpful, since the existence of continuous variables in our problems complicates their use. Vie develop relaxation and heuristic algorithms designed so as to provide tight lower and upper bounds to the optimal solution of the mixed combinatorial problem. In some cases the obtained range, in which the optimum lies, is small enough to be considered satisfactory by itself. This has been accomplished in problems with up to 150 variables. Exact algorithms have also been developed and guarantee the optimal solution upon termination. The idea of Branch and Bound enhanced with the use of lower and upper bounds obtained with the aforementioned methods is implemented for that purpose. Problems with up to 70 variables have been solved. Our ideas and algorithms are applied to the Problem of Index and Portfolio Replication with a limited number of assets. This problem arises in Finance, but, in its more general form, can find application in various areas ranging from Statistics to Optimal Control and Manufacturing.",

Here we show that cholinergic basal forebrain projections to V1 are necessary for the neural acquisition, but not the expression, of reward timing in the visual cortex of awake, behaving animals. We then mimic reward timing in vitro by pairing white matter stimulation with muscarinic receptor activation at a fixed interval and show that this protocol results in the prolongation of electrically evoked spike train durations out to the conditioned interval. Together, these data suggest that V1 possesses the circuitry and plasticity to support reward time prediction learning and the cholinergic system serves as an important reinforcement signal which, in vivo, conveys to the cortex the outcome of behavior.",

        "Abstrak": "One of the most difficult challenges facing the development of modern gas turbines-for power generation, and propulsion-is the mitigation of dynamic instabilities in the presence of efficiency and emissions constraints. Dynamic instabilities-self-excited, self-sustaining oscillations which link the combustor acoustics to the combustion process-can result in significant levels of thermal and mechanical stress on combustion systems, leading to reduced operational lifetime, potentially dangerous failure modes, and significant deviations from the desired operating conditions. Due to the complexity of the problem, with the relevant time and length scales of the system--from the chemistry to the acoustics-spanning several orders of magnitude, even sophisticated numerical techniques have been severely limited in their ability to make reliable predictions, leaving the task of finding and eliminating modes of instability to a lengthy and expensive trial-and-error process. Lean-premixed combustion, one of the leading technologies for low emission combustors, is particularly susceptible to these types of instabilities. The sealed systems that are necessary to maintain a reaction in a lean mixture do not attenuate acoustics well, which often results in high-amplitude pressure fluctuations. In this thesis, we focus on developing a better predictive framework for the onset of combustion instabilities in a swirl-stabilized, lean-premixed combustor. We correlate the self-excited acoustic behavior with quantifiable system properties that can be generalized across different fuel blends. This work is predicated on the idea that self-excited combustion instability arises from the selective amplification of the noise inherent in a turbulent combustion system, and that the frequency-based response of the flame is a function of the flame geometry. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on the flame geometry, identifying several discrete transitions that take place in the swirl-stabilized flame as we adjust the equivalence ratio. By comparing the transitions across several CH₄/H₂ fuel blends, and using statistical techniques to interrogate the global effect of the small-scale flow-flame interactions, we find that the extinction strain rate-the flow-driven rate of change in flame surface area at which the chemistry is no longer -sufficiently fast to maintain the reaction-is directly linked to the flame transitions. The swirl-stabilized flow features several critical regions with large and unsteady velocity derivatives, particularly, a pair of shear layers that divide the incoming flow of reactants from an inner and an outer recirculation zone. As the extinction strain rate increases with increasing equivalence ratio, the flame transitions through these critical regions, manifesting as discrete changes in the flame geometry. In the second part, we address the correlation between self-excited instability and the forced acoustic response. By modifying the pressure boundary conditions, we decouple the flame from the acoustics over a domain of interest (defined by a range of equivalence ratios that correspond to the onset of dynamic instability in the coupled system). We then apply external acoustic forcing at a single frequency to ascertain the response of the flame to each particular forcing frequency by means of a flame transfer function. This enables us to consider the frequency-by-frequency response of the flame to its own internally generated noise. We show that the onset of instability is well-predicted by the overlap of the natural acoustic frequencies of the combustor (predicted using a non-linear flame response model) with those frequencies for which the phase of the flame transfer function satisfies the well-known Rayleigh criterion, which is a necessary condition for the presence of self-excited combustion instability. By examining both the forced response and the self-excited instability across several different fuel blends, we go on to show that both behaviors correlate well with the flame geometry, which we have already shown to be dictated by the extinction strain rate of the particular fuel blend. We go on to collapse both sets of data on the strained flame consumption speed taken at the limit of the extinction strain rate, and in doing so, present a framework for predicting the operating conditions under which the combustor in the coupled configuration will go unstable based on measurements and correlations from the uncoupled configuration. Furthermore by taking the consumption speed at the extinction limit, we are correlating the geometry and dynamics with a parameter that is solely a function of mixture properties. This provides the basis for a framework for predicting instability from properties that are more readily measured or simulated, and provides and explicit means of converting these results to different fuel mixtures.",

In awake mice, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded in layer 4 of binocular visual cortex undergo increases in amplitude with repeated presentation of a sinusoidal grating stimulus over days. This effect is highly specific to the experienced stimulus. Here, we test whether the mechanisms of thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP), induced with a theta burst electrical stimulation (TBS) of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, are sufficient to account for SRP. First, we demonstrate that LTP similarly enhances the amplitude of VEPs, but in a way that generalizes across multiple stimuli, spatial frequencies, and contrasts. Second, we show that LTP occludes the subsequent expression of SRP. Third, we reveal that previous SRP occludes TBS-induced LTP of the VEP evoked by the experienced stimulus, but not by unfamiliar stimuli. Finally, we show that SRP is rapidly and selectively reversed by local cortical infusion of a peptide that inhibits PKMζ, a constitutively active kinase known to maintain NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and memory. Thus, SRP is expressed by the same core mechanisms as LTP. SRP therefore provides a simple assay to assess the integrity of LTP in the intact nervous system. Moreover, the results suggest that LTP of visual cortex, like SRP, can potentially be exploited to improve vision.",

In particular, it analyzes: Net Present Value (NPV), Decision Analysis (DA) and Real Options Analysis (ROA), and compares these approaches in terms of their treatment of uncertainty, their acknowledgement of flexibility, and their usefulness for strategic decisionmaking. The comparison of these alternative methodologies is based on a literature review highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, complemented by a system study of the expansion of the water supply system for Bogota, Colombia. This study illustrates the application of each methodology and identifies the policy challenges relevant to infrastructure investment evaluation in Colombia and other emerging economies. The study confirms the hypothesis that NPV is inadequate for the evaluation of projects in uncertain environments, mainly because it does not account for the value generated by flexibility. The study also recognizes that although the ROA approach is theoretically superior in the pricing of flexibility, its implementation requires information usually not available for infrastructure assets. This rends the results of the analyses imprecise and complicates the process of identifying an optimal strategy. The study finds the Decision Analysis approach preferable for the evaluation of Bogota's water supply expansion projects, based on its practicality and ease of communication. The thesis also sets forth a framework for choosing the most appropriate capital budgeting technique for other infrastructure developments. This framework is based on data quality and availability and the objective function of the analysis to be conducted.",

        "Abstrak": "Sustainable success in product design and development relies not only on technical expertise and creativity within the company but as crucially, if not more, on an intelligent design of the development process, an appropriate and dynamic management of organizations, a realistic and disciplined project management, and on efficient knowledge generation, conservation and distribution techniques. These non-engineering skills pose serious challenges to companies designing complex systems like airplanes or automobiles. As these systems have gotten tremendously more complex, their design has kept involving more people, from different working cultures inside and outside the company, all within tighter time constraints. Adaptation to this new context of product development has nevertheless often been very slow because of persistent corporate traditions inherited from the past. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that Process Mapping and Improvement, Organizations Management, Project Management and Knowledge Management can be reconciled and performed all at once using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) Method, enabling large and relatively easy improvements of the design activity's efficiency. The state-of-the-art in each of the four mentioned fields is first reviewed. The methodology used throughout this thesis, the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is then presented. The DSM method and some issues of knowledge management are illustrated in a short case study conducted in January 2002 at PSA Peugeot-Citroen in Paris, France. The promising unifying benefits of the DSM method are then thoroughly described through a large project that took place in Summer 2002 at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan. It exhibits how DSMs can provide permanent system-level knowledge, guide the design practitioner through a complex process that would hardly be understood otherwise, enable a dynamic management of organizations and open opportunities for process improvement and redesign. The lessons learned finally lead to recommendations on the practice of the DSM method as well as product development in general.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation is concerned with two puzzles in the syntax of French noun phrases. I first examine the distribution of the sub nominal clitic pronoun en. I argue that Case theory is the module of the grammar responsible for the well-known contrast in grammaticality between genitive en and quantitative en when they appear with derived (raised) subjects of unaccusative verbs. I argue that Case is a feature of the nominal head of a DP. Extraction of the nominal head by quantitative en creates a DP remnant which is incapable of checking Case, since it lacks the necessary feature. Genitive en does not extract the nominal head, and its remnant contains a Case feature. I show that Case theory makes the correct predictions regarding the distribution of genitive en and quantitative en in a large number of contexts, many of which were problematic for previous accounts in terms of Binding Theory or the Empty Category Principle (ECP). The Case theoretical approach also predicts the Definiteness Restriction on the extraction of quantitative en, as well as the obligatory narrow scope of its remnant. The second puzzle is provided by Quantification at a Distance (QAD) in French. I argue that also in this case the subject/object asymmetry observed with remnants is to be explained by Case theory. QAD remnants are deficient noun phrases and are not eligible candidates for Case Checking in the specifier of a functional projection. I show how a Case theoretical approach to QAD predicts the obligatory narrow scope of QAD remnants as well as the fact that only weak determiners are members of the beaucoup class. I propose that there are three ways of Checking Case: head movement of N, head movement of D preceded by feature movement of the Case feature to D, and DP movement. Finally I show that the analysis of en cliticization and QAD can be used to shed light on the position of subjects in Stylistic Inversion contexts. More generally the thesis is a contribution to the theory of feature checking, and provides a new approach to problems usually attributed to the ECP.",

        "Abstrak": "For applications involving the control of  moving vehicles, the recovery of relative  motion between a camera and its  environment is of high utility. This thesis  describes the design and testing of a real-time analog VLSI chip which estimates the  focus of expansion (FOE) from measured  time-varying images. Our approach assumes  a camera moving through a fixed world with  translational velocity; the FOE is the projection  of the translation vector onto the image plane.  This location is the point towards which the  camera is moving, and other points appear to  be expanding outward from. By way of the  camera imaging parameters, the location of  the FOE gives the direction of 3-D translation.  The algorithm we use for estimating the FOE  minimizes the sum of squares of the  differences at every pixel between the  observed time variation of brightness and the  predicted variation given the assumed  position of the FOE. This minimization is not  straightforward, because the relationship  between the brightness derivatives depends  on the unknown distance to the surface being  imaged. However, image points where  brightness is instantaneously constant play a  critical role. Ideally, the FOE would be at the  intersection of the tangents to the iso-brightness contours at these \"stationary\"  points. In practice, brightness derivatives are  hard to estimate accurately given that the  image is quite noisy. Reliable results can  nevertheless be obtained if the image  contains many stationary points and the point  is found that minimizes the sum of squares of  the perpendicular distances from the tangents  at the stationary points. The FOE chip  calculates the gradient of this least-squares  minimization sum, and the estimation is  performed by closing a feedback loop around  it. The chip has been implemented using an  embedded CCD imager for image acquisition  and a row-parallel processing scheme. A 64  x 64 version was fabricated in a 2um CCD/ BiCMOS process through MOSIS with a  design goal of 200 mW of on-chip power, a  top frame rate of 1000 frames/second, and a  basic accuracy of 5%. A complete  experimental system which estimates the  FOE in real time using real motion and image  scenes is demonstrated.",

The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of loss aversion rather than a desire for flexibility.The first essay studies the credibility of non-commitment advertising. To attract potential customers, retailers often advertise low prices with appeals such as Prices start at $49 or One week in the Caribbean from $449. We offer here an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image in the absence of any commitment based on the role of selling costs. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is so because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher priced products imposes unwanted selling costs, but yields little extra revenue. We show analytically that such advertising can be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers' cost types or the selling cost is high. The second essay analyzes the free-riding problem under the situation where the selling costs are high. Intuitively, we can expect that free-riding will hurt the retailer who provides service. Nonetheless, we analytically show that free-riding actually benefits not only the free-riding retailer, but also the retailer who provides service. The intuition behind this result is that by allowing free-riding, the service provider can induce a softer re-action from its competitor who now enjoy free-riding. Therefore, allowing free-riding can be regarded as a strategic investment which prevents an aggressive response from the other retailer. The third essay adopts an experimental approach to the study of incentives. The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way such options are valued. In four experiments using door games, we demonstrate that options",

Each essay, from different angles, examines the relation between managers' incentives and financial accounting information. The first essay examines how a firm's choice between competing innovation strategies can be affected by the use of accounting information versus stock prices as performance measures in the firm's CEO compensation contract. Firms obtain new technology either through internal R&D or through acquisitions. These two approaches are usually labeled as \"make\" and \"buy\" strategies. In this paper, I focus on the two major differences between the \"make\" and \"buy\" strategies: risk levels and accounting treatment. I hypothesize that the high risk level and unfavorable accounting treatment associated with \"make\" strategy relative to \"buy\" strategy lead risk-averse managers to favor \"buy\" over \"make,\" should they be compensated heavily using accounting-based performance measures. Stock-based compensation, especially stock options, on the other hand, should encourage managers to innovate more through \"make\" strategies instead of\"buying\" them from the outside. Using data from US high tech industries, I find evidence consistent with the above hypotheses. The second essay examines whether managers of information-strained firms signal the firm's future performance by managing earnings to exceed thresholds. Because managers' reporting discretion is bounded by the accounting regulations, managing earnings to exceed the current period's thresholds reduces future earnings, making future earnings thresholds more difficult to attain. As a result, only firms with sufficient future earnings growth can benefit from doing so. My empirical results suggest that the earnings management activities",

        "Abstrak": "(cont.) Slow information diffusion can cause return momentum. Institutions are thought to be more informed than individuals, and should eliminate return predictability. However, higher institutional ownership is associated with more momentum. Therefore, institutions either herd on returns or can have information before individuals. I find evidence of the latter. However, the effects are economically small, suggesting that aggregate data obscures differences between institutions. I divide institutions by trading aggressiveness. Aggressive institutions are more responsive to recent returns, and a strategy mimicking their trades generates even better performance. This confirms that some investors are more informed than others, but do not eliminate return predictability.This thesis consists of three chapters, each about a separate aspect of how investors respond to information in equity markets. The first chapter concerns news and stock returns. Using a comprehensive database of headlines about individual companies, I examine monthly returns following public news. I compare them to stocks with similar returns, but no identifiable public news. There is a difference between the two sets. I find strong drift after bad news. Investors seem to react slowly to this information. I also find reversal after extreme price movements unaccompanied by public news. The separate patterns appear even after adjustments for risk exposure and other effects. They are, however, mainly seen in smaller, more illiquid stocks. These findings support some integrated theories of investor over- and underreaction. The second chapter is joint work with Richard Frankel and S. P. Kothari. Models based on psychology can explain momentum and reversal in stock returns, but may be overfitted to data. We examine a typical basis for these models, representativeness, in which individuals predict the future based on how closely past outcomes fit certain categories. We use accounting performance to mimic possible investor-defined categories for firm performance. We test the idea that investors predictably bias their expectations about future operations by using these categories. We find little evidence that the sequence or trend of past accounting performance is related to future returns, and is therefore unlikely to bias investor expectations. The third chapter concerns how informational advantage differs between institutional investors.",

        "Abstrak": "The coupling between polymer models and experiments has improved our understanding of polymer behavior both in terms of rheology and dynamics of single molecules. Developing these polymer models is challenging because of the wide range of time and length scales. Mechanical models of polymers have been used to understand average heological properties as well as the deviation a single polymer molecule has from the average response. This leads to more physically significant constitutive relations, which can be coupled with fluid mechanic simulations to predict and understand the theological response of polymer solutions and melts. These models have also been used in conjunction with single molecule polymer experiments. While these have provided insight into the dynamics of polymers in rheological flows, they have also helped to design single molecule manipulation experiments. Promising research in this area includes DNA separation and stretching devices. A typical atomic bond has a length of 10-10m and vibration time scale of 10-14s. A typical experiment in a microfluidic device has lengths of order 10-5m and times of order 102s. It is not possible to capture these larger length and time scales of interest while capturing exactly the behavior at the smaller length and time scales.(cont.) This necessitates a process of coarse-graining which sacrifices the details at the small scale which are not necessary while retaining the important features that do affect the response at the larger scales. This thesis focuses on the coarse-graining of polymers into a series of beads connected by springs. The function which gives the retractive force in the spring as a function of the extension is called the spring force law. In many new microfluidic applications the previously used spring force laws produce significant errors in the model. We have systematically analyzed the coarse-graining and development of the spring force law to understand why these force laws fail. In particular, we analyzed the force-extension behavior which quantifies how much the polymer extends under application of an external force. We identified the key dimensionless group that governs the response and found that it is important to understand the different constraints under which the polymer is placed. This understanding led to the development of new spring force laws which are accurate coarse-grained models by construction. We also examined the response in other situations such as weak and strong flows.(cont.) This further illustrated the disadvantages of the previous force laws which were eliminated by using the new force laws. This thesis will have practical impact because the new spring force laws can easily be implemented in current polymer models. This will improve the accuracy of the models and place the models on firmer theoretical footing. Because the spring force law has been developed independently of other coarse-grained interactions, this thesis will also help in determining the best parameters for other interactions because they will not need to compensate for an error in the spring force law. These new spring force laws will help form the framework of coarse-grained models which can help understand a wide range of situations in which the behavior at a small scale affects the large time and length scale behavior.",

Currently most gene models for the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, are based on computer model predictions without cDNA sequence verification. Additionally, the nature and extent of alternative splicing in Toxoplasma gondii is unknown. In this study, we used de novo transcript assembly and the published type II (ME49) genomic sequence to quantify the extent of alternative splicing in Toxoplasma and to improve the current Toxoplasma gene annotations. Results: We used high-throughput RNA-sequencing data to assemble full-length transcripts, independently of a reference genome, followed by gene annotation based on the ME49 genome. We assembled 13,533 transcripts overlapping with known ME49 genes in ToxoDB and then used this set to; a) improve the annotation in the untranslated regions of ToxoDB genes, b) identify novel exons within protein-coding ToxoDB genes, and c) report on 50 previously unidentified alternatively spliced transcripts. Additionally, we assembled a set of 2,930 transcripts not overlapping with any known ME49 genes in ToxoDB. From this set, we have identified 118 new ME49 genes, 18 novel Toxoplasma genes, and putative non-coding RNAs. Conclusion: RNA-seq data and de novo transcript assembly provide a robust way to update incompletely annotated genomes, like the Toxoplasma genome. We have used RNA-seq to improve the annotation of several Toxoplasma genes, identify alternatively spliced genes, novel genes, novel exons, and putative non-coding RNAs.",

        "Abstrak": "While variations in public securities markets across nations have attracted increasing scrutiny, private financings\r\n                  have received little attention. But in developing nations, the bulk of financings are private ones. This paper analyzes\r\n                  210 private equity transactions in developing countries. We find that unlike in the U.S., where convertible preferred\r\n                  securities are ubiquitous, in developing nations a much broader array of securities are employed and private equity\r\n                  investors often have fewer contractual protections. The choice of security appears to be driven by the legal and\r\n                  economic circumstances of the nation and the private equity group. Investments in common law nations are\r\n                  structured similar to those in the U.S., being less likely to employ common stock or straight debt, and more likely to\r\n                  use preferred stock with a variety of covenants. By way of contrast, in nations where the rule of law is less\r\n                  established, private equity groups are likely to use common stock and own the majority of the firm's equity if the\r\n                  investment encounters difficulties. Private equity groups based in the U.S. and U.K. rely more on preferred\r\n                  securities but also adapt transactions to local conditions. These contractual differences appear to have real\r\n                  consequences: larger transactions with higher valuations are seen in common law countries. These findings suggest\r\n                  that the structure of a country's legal system affects private contracts and cannot easily be undone by (bi-lateral)\r\n                  private solutions.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation consists of three essays that examine banking and corporate finance in developing countries. Specifically, it explores the theoretical and empirical implications of open capital markets, foreign bank entry, and the role of bond markets during banking crises. Chapter 1 analyzes the impact of opening capital markets using a theoretical model that incorporates both foreign and domestic lenders in the presence of asymmetric information. The model suggests that when foreign lenders are limited in their ability to obtain information about entrepreneurs, they may engage in cream-skimming by only targeting the largest, most profitable firms. This cream-skimming can induce a reallocation of credit that may either increase or decrease overall net output of the open economy. The consequences of this credit reallocation depend on the type of financial opening and the quality of domestic institutions. Chapter 2 examines the entry of foreign banks as a specific case of opening capital markets. I estimate the impact of entry using variation in the location of foreign banks established in India following a policy change in 1994. The estimates indicate that the 10 percent most profitable firms received larger bank loans, but that on average, firms were 7.6 percentage points less likely to have a loan after entry.(cont.) The decline in loans was uncorrelated with firms' profitability and driven by a decrease among group-affiliated firms. The reallocation is consistent with the presence of asymmetric information, and similar estimates are obtained using the location of pre-existing foreign firms as an instrument for the location choice of new banks. Chapter 3, co-authored with Simon Johnson and Changyong Rhee, uses a quasi-natural experiment in Korea after the 1997-98 financial crises to assess bond markets in emerging economies. Evidence confirms that bond markets can develop quickly during a banking crisis and act as a 'spare tire' even when almost all previous private finance flowed through the banking system. However, access to bonds was feasible only for the largest firms, and there is no evidence that bond finance was better directed than bank finance. Firms with weaker pre-crisis corporate governance were no less likely to obtain bond financing.",

They are also biased towards a single market factor, the importance of which is overestimated in samples. In Chapter 3, I derive a new consistent procedure for the estimation of the number of latent factors by examining the effect of the idiosyncratic noise in a factor model. Furthermore, I show that the estimation of factor loadings by Principal Components Analysis is inconsistent for weak factors and suggest alternative Instrumental Variables procedures. Chapter 4 uses the theoretical results of the earlier chapters to estimate the stochastic dimension of the US economy and shows that global risk factors may obfuscate the relationship between inflation and unemployment. Chapter 5 (co-authored with Jerry Hausman) suggests a new procedure for the estimation of discrete choice models with random coe±cients and shows that ignoring individual taste heterogeneity can lead to misleading policy counterfactuals.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis presents three empirical essays on the teacher labor market. Chapter one exploits the exogenous variation in teacher pay arising from state-mandated pay increases to identify the causal effect of teacher pay on teacher qualifications. Results suggest that, while state-mandated increases do raise teacher pay, they lead in the short run to a reduction in teacher quality as measured by the selectivity of a teacher's undergraduate institution and the probability that math and science teachers majored in these fields. This result appears to be due to the fact that, in the wake of an across-the-board pay hike, newly hired teachers are of lower quality than incumbents. Chapter two estimates the impact of state-mandated pay raises on the likelihood of a teacher exiting the state public school system. To explore the effects on the quality of the teacher workforce, the analysis also investigates whether the responsiveness of the exit decision to the pay raise varies with the subject matter expertise of the teacher, as measured by the type of degree held. The findings suggest that general pay raises tend to increase the retention of experienced teachers, particularly at the secondary school level.(cont.) However, the strength of the retention effect varies with the subject matter expertise of the teacher and the union status of the district. In nonunion districts, the retention effects are stronger for experienced teachers with academic degrees than for those with education degrees. The opposite relationship holds in union districts. Chapter three uses a conditional logit model to investigate the determinants of a new teacher's choice of state in which to begin teaching, as a function of salary, student characteristics, and geographic proximity to the college state. The findings indicate that geographic proximity and proportion minority enrollment dominate the location decision. The overall salary level does not appear to influence the probability of a teacher locating in a state.",

It finds that, for each ability level, it is optimal to subsidize monetary educational costs at the same marginal rate at which income is being taxed. Chapter 3 finds that when entrepreneurial labor income cannot be observed separately from capital income, then it is optimal to have positive capital taxation in the long run.

        "Abstrak": "A fundamental study of the Direct Current Electric Arc Furnace (DC-EAF) for steel-making has been carried out through the development of a rigorous mathematical model. The mathematical representation involves the simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields, and the turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer equations. In solving the arc and bath regions it was assumed ( and justified) that the arc-bath interactions are dominated by the behavior of the arc. In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration at the bottom of the reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and ladle metallurgy physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e.g., arc current, arc length, bath dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e.g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10,000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i.e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths.  Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, refractory wear, temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents refractory wear, and promotes arc heating efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent refractory wear. The presence of a top layer of slag reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations.",

We show that the three-body recombination rate in such a system in the dilute limit has a characteristic logarithmic-periodic dependence on the effective scattering length with the scaling factor 22.0 and can be expressed by formulas similar to those for identical bosons in three dimensions.

Here we provide evidence that multiple mechanisms control asymmetry for distinct brain systems. Using intrinsic activity to measure asymmetry in 300 adults, we mapped the most strongly lateralized brain regions. Both men and women showed strong asymmetries with a significant, but small, group difference. Factor analysis on the asymmetric regions revealed 4 separate factors that each accounted for significant variation across subjects. The factors were associated with brain systems involved in vision, internal thought (the default network), attention, and language. An independent sample of right- and left-handed individuals showed that hand dominance affects brain asymmetry but differentially across the 4 factors supporting their independence. These findings show the feasibility of measuring brain asymmetry using intrinsic activity fluctuations and suggest that multiple genetic or environmental mechanisms control cerebral lateralization.",

        "Abstrak": "As digital entertainment applications evolve, there is a need for new kinds of platforms that can support sociable media interactions for everyday consumers. This thesis demonstrates an extensible method and sensing framework for real-time tracking of multiple objects on an interactive table with an embedded display. This tabletop platform can support many different applications, and is designed to overcome the commercial obstacles of previous single purpose systems. The approach is supported through the design and implementation of an acoustic-based sensing system that provides a means for managing large numbers of objects and applications across multiple platform instances. The design requires precise and dynamic positioning of multiple objects in order to enable real-time multi-user interactions with media applications. Technical analysis shows the approach l:o be robust, scalable to various sizes, and accurate to a within a few millimeters of tolerance. A qualitative user evaluation of the table within a real-world setting illustrates its usability in the consumer entertainment space for digital media browsing and game play. Our observations revealed different ways of mapping physical interaction objects to the media space, as either generic controls or fixed function devices, and highlighted the issue of directionality on visual displays that are viewable from different sides.(cont.) The thesis suggests that by providing a general purpose method for shared tabletop display platforms we give application designers the freedom to invent a broad range of media interactions and applications for everyday social environments, such as homes, classrooms and public spaces. Contributions of the thesis include: formulation of an extensible method for media table platforms; development of a novel sensing approach for dynamic object tracking on glass surfaces; a taxonomy of interface design considerations; and prototype designs for media content browsing, digital storytelling and game play applications.",

        "Abstrak": "Nanobiotechnology aims to exploit biomolecular recognition and self-assembly capabilities for integrating advanced materials into medicine and electronics. In particular, peptides have exhibited the ability to specifically bind to and/or control the synthesis of diverse inorganic and metallic materials including those with electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. However, in order to mature into an engineering discipline, a fundamental understanding of how peptide chemical composition and amino acid spatial arrangement relate to interfacial function and specificity is essential. This work discloses general principles governing peptide-inorganic material surface interactions at the level of amino acid functional groups. To facilitate fundamental studies, methodologies broadly applicable to probing sequence-activity relationships of peptide-inorganic material surface interactions were developed. A yeast surface display system adapted to liquid-solid interfaces enabled surgical manipulation of sequence through genetic techniques and rapid, semi- quantitation of peptide-materials binding strength. Cells displaying material specific polypeptides were also shown to form self-healing biofilms and discriminate between surfaces of fabricated heterostructure materials. The influence of peptide sequence on aqueous formation of photoluminescent CdS nanoparticles was studied with synthetic soluble peptides and higher throughput methods. Systematic study of peptide sequence-activity relationships concluded that surface binding depends primarily on composition; For the single crystalline II-VI semiconductors CdS, CdSe, ZnS, and ZnSe, and polycrystalline Au studied, only residues from the group of histidine, tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine appeared sufficient for significant binding.(cont.) Additionally, each material exhibited a unique fingerprint of binder- modulator relationships, where spatially proximal amino acids tuned the binding strength of binder-residues in unconstrained peptides. This hierarchal set of compositional and spatial criteria was applied to rationalize sequence-activity relationships observed for genetically identified peptides. Also, peptide binding strength was found to have a curved-linear correlation with the ability to mediate nanoparticle formation; Intermediate peptide-CdS binding strength yielded optimal CdS nanoparticle photoluminescence as did peptides with greater compositional diversity. Finally, by employing the criteria developed herein, we demonstrated the ability to predictively engineer peptides with specific, differential affinities for surfaces of closely related inorganic materials.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation consists of three essays in empirical labor and health economics. The first chapter examines how the amount of time devoted to a leisure activity varies in response to temporary changes in the price of that activity. Specifically, I estimate the effect of changes in expected winnings in an online poker game on the probability that players quit playing. I find that expected winnings have a large negative effect on the probability that a player quits playing poker. A one dollar increase in expected winnings decreases the probability that a player quits playing altogether by 0.5 percentage points, compared to the mean of 1.1 percentage points. This corresponds to a price elasticity of demand for poker of -0.14. The second chapter develops and tests a model of how college students choose their field of study. The model combines features from learning and human capital models and captures several stylized facts from the empirical literature on choice of college major. I test the model's predictions using High School and Beyond data. I find three results that generally agree with the model's predictions. First, students with higher levels of ability choose majors with higher average earnings. Second, students who receive low grades in college are more likely to change their field of study. Third, students who switch majors in college subsequently earn less than students who do not change majors, but this difference is primarily due to major-switchers obtaining degrees in low-paying fields. The third chapter, coauthored with Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Gilles Postel-Vinay, provides estimates of the long-term effects on height and health of a large income shock experienced in early childhood.(cont.) Phylloxera, an insect that attacks the roots of grape vines, destroyed 40% of French vineyards between 1863 and 1890, causing major income losses among wine growing families. We exploit the regional variation in the timing of this shock to identify its effects. We find that, at age 20, those born in affected regions were about 1.8 millimeters shorter than others. This estimate implies that children of wine-growing families born when the vines were affected in their regions were 0.6 to 0.9 centimeters shorter than others by age 20. This is a significant effect since average heights grew by only 2 centimeters in the entire 19th century.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation is composed of three chapters. The first demonstrates that natural gas violates many of the simplifying assumptions frequently used in modeling its behavior. Careful analysis of futures contracts written on gas suggests that gas prices are seasonal while returns are non-Gaussian and evidence stochastic volatility. In addition, examination of options prices indicates the intermittent presence of jumps. We find that models which disregard these properties struggle to recover options prices with any precision. Thus, we propose an alternative nonparametric approach to gas options pricing that captures these salient features while also shedding light on the nature of risk aversion embedded in gas markets. The second chapter offers a parametric approach to pricing derivatives written on natural gas futures designed to overcome the shortcomings of existing parametric schemes. First, it proposes a model of the underlying futures prices that admits stochastic volatility. Second, it makes use of a state-of-the-art Bayesian particle filtering technique to estimate the underlying process parameters along with a simulation-based technique for option pricing. While it trades off some performance relative to nonparametric approaches, such as the kernel scheme employed in the first chapter, the strategy employed is very general and allows for the pricing of more complex derivatives. The final chapter presents new estimates and approaches to estimating the home bias puzzle. It uses micro-level data to calculate households' foreign equity exposure as a function of wealth. We find simple estimates have significant errors-in-variables problems and we construct an estimator using grouping to account for this issue. Our estimates still imply low aggregate investment in foreign equity.(cont) Finally, we disaggregate the investment decision by incorporating two step decisions that allow households to forgo participating in the market. As a result of the decoupling, we find foreign equity levels closer to that of standard portfolio theories.",

For example, nearly 70% of respondents to a recent global survey of IT workers and business users called data integration a high inhibitor of new application implementation. A number of frameworks and tools have been developed to enable data integration tasks. The most prominent include schema matching, use of ontologies and logic-based techniques. A joint project by UFL and MIT, Morpheus, has attacked the same problem with a unique emphasis on re-use and sharing. In the first part of the thesis, we try to define software re-use and sharing in the context of data integration and contrast this approach with existing integration techniques. We synthesize previous work in the field with our experience demoing Morpheus to an audience of research labs and companies. At the heart of a system with re-usable components is browsing and searching capabilities. The second part of this thesis describes TransformScout, a transform composition search engine that automates composition of re-usable components. Similarity and quality metrics have been formulated for recommending the users with a ranked collection of composite transforms. In addition, the system learns from user feedback to improve the quality of the query results. We conducted a user study to both evaluate Morpheus as a system and to assess TransformScout's performance in helping completing programming tasks. Results indicate that software re-use with Morpheus and TransformScout has helped the user perform the programming tasks faster. Moreover, TransformScout was useful in aiding the users with completing the tasks more reliably.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation consists of three chapters in which I address metaphysical and epistemological issues that arise in psychiatry, with particular attention paid to anti-psychiatric concerns. In Chapter 1, I consider three versions of anti-realism about psychiatric illness. I argue that Szasz's version of anti-realism should be rejected because it rests on a misunderstanding of illnesses more generally. Although I do not offer any clear refutations of labeling theory or cultural relativism, I point out the serious disadvantages of holding either view. I argue that in the absence of compelling reasons to endorse either labeling theory or cultural relativism, we are within our rights to remain realists about psychiatric illness. In Chapter 2, I address an epistemological concern that the scientific legitimacy of psychiatric taxonomy is compromised by the role that value judgments play in the study of mental disorders. I claim that this worry presupposes a view of science according to which objective observation and theory construction would not even be possible. I argue that, on a revised understanding of science proposed by Helen Longino, a scientifically legitimate psychiatric taxonomy is within our reach. Finally, in Chapter 3, I turn to the metaphysical problem of providing an account of disorders. An important part of a realist view of mental disorders includes an account of disorders. I claim that in light of available evidence of the heterogeneity of disorders, it is unlikely that disorders share an essence, and I argue that previous attempts to provide a Lockean account of disorders fail for this reason. I propose instead that disorders are homeostatic property cluster kinds of the sort first described by Richard Boyd.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation studies a moment of transition in German aesthetics in the late nineteenth century. Starting in the 1870s, groups of artists, architects, historians, critics, connoisseurs, and museum officials in Germany declared that traditional aesthetics, which had operated \"from above\" with metaphysical concepts such as the beautiful and the sublime, was obsolete. According to these intellectuals, the old aesthetics needed to be replaced by a scientific and empirical \"aesthetics from below.\" The emergence of the new aesthetics was closely related to the rise of mass politics and mass culture in the newly unified Germany. Concerned that an attentive and contemplative perception could not be afforded by the masses, these liberal-minded members of the educated middle classes theorized a new kind of aesthetic experience that was based on corporeal pleasure rather than intellectual judgment. According to this model, an aesthetic encounter with an artwork was primarily kinaesthetic: an artwork elicited an unconscious and immediate effect on the musculature of its beholder. I examine three episodes, in which this idea was employed to pedagogical ends at the turn of the twentieth century. In the work of the artist Hermann Obrist (1862-1927), the kinaesthetic model of experience became the basis of a new pedagogy for the arts, which utilized the unconscious movements of the body to choreograph the production and reception of aesthetic effects. The architect August Endell (1871-1925) theorized these effects further and attempted to invent an exact science of design, which correlated architectural forms to the reaction that they would produce in the human body.(cont.) The same idea of kinaesthetic response appeared within art historical circles under the rubric of the Baroque at the turn of the twentieth century, particularly in the debates between Heinrich Wilfflin (1864-1945) and August Schmarsow (1853-1936) on the nature of the painterly (malerisch). The double slide lecture was an ingenious solution devised by the incipient discipline of modern art history simultaneously to utilize the pedagogical effectiveness of kinaesthetic experience and to control its sensual excess.",

        "Abstrak": "In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the collection of local features or parts that comprise it. In computer vision in particular, local image features are a powerful way to describe images of objects and scenes. Their stability under variable image conditions is critical for success in a wide range of recognition and retrieval applications. However, many conventional similarity measures and machine learning algorithms assume vector inputs. Comparing and learning from images represented by sets of local features is therefore challenging, since each set may vary in cardinality and its elements lack a meaningful ordering. In this thesis I present computationally efficient techniques to handle comparisons, learning, and indexing with examples represented by sets of features. The primary goal of this research is to design and demonstrate algorithms that can effectively accommodate this useful representation in a way that scales with both the representation size as well as the number of images available for indexing or learning.I introduce the pyramid match algorithm, which efficiently forms an implicit partial matching between two sets of feature vectors. The matching has a linear time complexity, naturally forms a Mercer kernel, and is robust to clutter or outlier features, a critical advantage for handling images with variable backgrounds, occlusions, and viewpoint changes. I provide bounds on the expected error relative to the optimal partial matching. For very large databases, even extremely efficient pairwise comparisons may not offer adequately responsive query times. I show how to perform sub-linear time retrievals under the matching measure with randomized hashing techniques, even when input sets have varying numbers of features.My results are focused on several important vision tasks, including applications to content-based image retrieval, discriminative classification for object recognition, kernel regression, and unsupervised learning of categories. I show how the dramatic increase in performance enables accurate and flexible image comparisons to be made on large-scale data sets, and removes the need to artificially limit the number of local descriptions used per image when learning visual categories.",

        "Abstrak": "A surprising portion of both mammalian and Drosophila genomes are transcriptionally paused, undergoing initiation without elongation. We tested the hypothesis that transcriptional pausing is an obligate transition state between definitive activation and silencing as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) change state from pluripotency to mesoderm. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for trimethyl lysine 4 on histone H3 (ChIP-Chip) was used to analyze transcriptional initiation, and 3′ transcript arrays were used to determine transcript elongation. Pluripotent and mesodermal cells had equivalent fractions of the genome in active and paused transcriptional states (∼48% each), with ∼4% definitively silenced (neither initiation nor elongation). Differentiation to mesoderm changed the transcriptional state of 12% of the genome, with roughly equal numbers of genes moving toward activation or silencing. Interestingly, almost all loci (98–99%) changing transcriptional state do so either by entering or exiting the paused state. A majority of these transitions involve either loss of initiation, as genes specifying alternate lineages are archived, or gain of initiation, in anticipation of future full-length expression. The addition of chromatin dynamics permitted much earlier predictions of final cell fate compared to sole use of conventional transcript arrays. These findings indicate that the paused state may be the major transition state for genes changing expression during differentiation, and implicate control of transcriptional elongation as a key checkpoint in lineage specification.",

        "Abstrak": "Host-microbe interactions play an important role in the physiology and evolution of animals. Interactions with microbes can generally be considered beneficial or pathogenic to the host. The ability of an organism to mount an immune response to infection by pathogenic microbes is critical to its survival, and basic mechanisms of innate immunity are conserved in evolutionarily diverse species. A pivotal signaling pathway in the evolutionarily conserved innate immune responses of multicellular organisms is the stress-activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This thesis focuses on the physiological role of p38 MAPK signaling in the host defense of Caenorhabditis elegans. In Chapter Two, I report the identification and characterization of the conserved ATF/CREB bZIP protein ATF-7 as the key transcriptional regulator of the PMK- 1 p38 MAPK-dependent immune response to pathogens. These data suggest a model in which the PMK- 1 p3 8 MAPK phosphorylates ATF-7 and switches it from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator of effector genes of the innate immune response of C. elegans. In Chapter Three, I characterize the roles of PMK- 1 and a second p38 MAPK ortholog, PMK-2, which are encoded in an operon, in tissue-specific signaling mechanisms involved in host defense. I show that PMK-2 functions redundantly with PMK- 1 in the nervous system to mediate neurobehavioral responses to pathogens. Furthermore, I demonstrate a role for the miR-58/80-82 family of microRNAs in regulating the tissue expression of pmk-2, which suggests a role for microRNAs in the establishment of tissue-specific expression of co-operonic genes. The work described in this thesis establishes the ancient evolutionary origins of the p38 MAPKCREB/ ATF pathway in innate immunity, and establishes a role for microRNAs in defining the tissue-expression pattern of co-operonic p38 MAPK genes. New directions for further understanding the ancient evolutionary mechanisms of p38 MAPK signaling and their tissue-specific regulation are discussed in Chapter Four.",

However, due to the complexity of the structure itself, the hydrodynamics of the BOP are difficult to model and therefore is the main focus on this thesis. First a general overview will be given on the challenges of offshore systems during the drilling phase when the BOP is installed directly above the wellhead. The current industrial standard suggested by DNV on the modelling of the BOP will be given.  In order to re-evaluate the problem, the non-dimensional analysis will be carried out and the key hydrodynamic effect parameters of the KC number, [beta] number and the angle of attack [alpha] will be identified. First sets of the experiments on scale-down BOP model conducted in the MIT Towing Tank show that the experimental measured hydrodynamic coefficients are drastically different from the industrial recommended modeling coefficients that the added mass coefficient Cm and the drag coefficient Cd both have a much larger value than the industrial model provided, and they vary significantly as the function of the key parameters. An equivalent box model was built and tested to capture the external shape of the BOP and used to address unusual hydrodynamic behavior. The box experiments successfully captured some major trends of the BOP model. It revealed that, first, the externally rectangle shape of the BOP will have a major impact on the variation of the added mass coefficient; second, the BOP model works in the range of overall laminar flow regime and thus, results in an inversely proportional relationship between the drag coefficient and KC number. However, the box model does not exhibit the large values of drag and added mass coefficient found in the BOP, which must be attributed to the multi-component structure of the BOP and the hydrodynamic interaction of the components. This was later confirmed through numerical and experimental visualization. Experiments on a model consisting of multiple cylinders exposed to the oscillatory flow are carried out in the MIT towing tank with varying parameters on KC number, [beta] number, Gap ratio and angle of attack [alpha]. Experimental results show that for side-by-side, at certain gap ratio, the drag coefficient of each cylinder will experience an increase, compared to the hydrodynamic of the single cylinder. This confirmed the BOP multi-structure hydrodynamic interaction effect. Also numerical work has been carried out through a 2D BDIM code, named Lilypad. The result confirms the experimental work, revealing that the increase in the drag coefficient is due to the formation of a jet between the Karman streets of the two adjacent cylinders.",

The processor design was implemented and simulated on two FPGA platforms, tested on multiple applications, and compared to three commercially available soft processor solutions in terms of features, area, clock frequency and benchmark performance.",

It was demonstrated that a new planar-chiral catalyst (1.5) is an excellent catalyst for the enantioselective addition of HN3 to hindered ketenes, en route to enantioenriched amines. The addition of HN3 to a ketene is likely occurring by the Bronsted acid catalysis mechanism. The evidence in support of the Bronsted acid catalysis mechanism include stereochemical and spectroscopic results, which are consistent with data from other additions believed to occur by the Bransted acid catalysis mechanism. Enantioenriched amines generated are a family of compounds distinct from the products yielded by earlier Bronsted acid catalyzed processes. In addition, with the use of highly acidic HN3, the pH range in which a planar-chiral catalyst can function as a Bransted acid catalyst was demonstrated to be much larger than previously known. ... The development of a tertiary amine catalyst for the enantioselective additions of HN3 to unhindered ketenes was investigated. Preliminary results indicate that catalyst 2.3a exhibits promising enantioselectivity for the addition of HN3 to unhindered ketenes and appears to be complementary to planar-chiral catalyst 1.5 in terms of substrate scope. ...",

The present use of the cushion is in wheelchair seating, but it may ultimately have application to general seating, particularly in situations where comfort is a significant consideration. The cushion is intended to optimally distribute the interface pressure on the seat of a wheelchair user, as well as to provide an opportunity for active pressure management. The principal goal in developing this cushion is the prevention of pressure sores (decubitis ulcers). The theoretical and design considerations upon which the cushion was developed are presented. Experimental materials data, as well as results of a prototype system, are supplied. A prototype cushion has been produced, and additional work is ongoing. The cushion uses vacuum to manipulate the elastic/collapse properties of open-cell foam; effectively setting a maximum pressure at the human interface. Assuming appropriate auxiliary hardware, pumps, controllers, and sensors it would be appropriate to use this cushion as the basis of an actively controlled seating system.",

        "Abstrak": "This three-paper dissertation focuses on olfactory perception, with each paper exploring an ongoing debate in the perceptual literature through the olfactory 'lens'. Philosophers of perception have typically assumed what I call the Unification Thesis: the thesis that certain philosophical issues about perception should be settled in the same way for each of the sensory modalities. I argue that olfaction presents special challenges to the Unification Thesis. Meeting these challenges rewards us with new insight into three topics: 1) the nature, and extent, of representational content, 2) qualia and the alleged transparency of experience and 3) the nature of the secondary qualities. In the first chapter, I consider the challenge that olfactory experience presents to upholding a representational view of the sense modalities. It is commonplace to suppose that visual experience is representational. But, given the phenomenology of olfactory experience, it is difficult to see how a representational view of it might go. I take on the challenge and argue for a representational account of olfactory experience that honors its phenomenology. In the second chapter, I consider what olfactory experience can tell us about the controversy over qualia and, in particular, the argument against them that focuses on the alleged transparency of experience. Although most transparency theorists claim that transparency holds for all of the sense modalities, transparency seems unintuitive for olfactory experience. I argue that olfactory experience is indeed transparent and that explanations of what transparency is supposed to be have been obscured by a reliance on the visual model.(cont.) In the final chapter, I turn to the question of what smells are. For many philosophers, the view that colors can be explained in purely physicalistic terms has seemed very appealing. In the case of smell, this kind of view has seemed less appealing. Philosophers have been drawn to the view that the nature of smells must be explained in terms of our subjective reactions. In this chapter, I consider a contemporary argument for this view for the case of color. I argue that physicalistic views of smell have nothing to fear from this argument.",

Also discussed is the impact that quality lighting has on our health, safety, socio-economic status and the environment that surrounds us. Not surprisingly the demand for quality artificial lighting is high in these communities, where access is generally limited. SELCO-India, a registered company, sells photovoltaic-based home lighting systems; while THRIVE, a nonprofit organization, sells Light Emitting Diode (LED) lanterns to remote communities in India. Both organizations use alternative models to address the same issue.

The thesis presents data on CFIT mishaps, causes, and efforts to reduce CFIT mishaps through the development and adoption of Ground Collision Avoidance Systems (GCAS) or similar designs - Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS exist today on some USAF aircraft, but many times these systems are inadequate (as evidenced by the continued occurrence of CFIT mishaps). Both ongoing and future initiatives by the USAF to adopt and develop better GPWS/GCAS systems were studied. An analysis was performed which studied the cost to the USAF (and the U.S. taxpayer) as a result of CFIT mishaps, and compared with an analysis of the cost to develop and implement improved GPWS/GCAS systems. The results show conclusively that installing GCAS/GPWS on a majority of USAF aircraft is cost effective. Technology exist today which could improve existing GPWS performance, and although efforts to improve GPWS are moving forward, some resistance does exist. Possible reasons for resistance of GCAS/GPWS adoption were studied and several recommendations were made on how to improve the adoption of these systems within the USAF.",

The frequencies and forces produced by unencased and encased pancake motors were measured, and a motor model was formulated to simulate the motion of the motors. It was found that there was considerate variability between pancake motors, and it was proposed that this may be due to a varying damping coefficient. A viscoelastic substrate, named Skinsim, was selected based on mechanical tests to have similar material properties to skin. It was found that when the motors were mounted on Skinsim their frequency of vibration was reduced by 62%. Measurements of the effects of damping in Skinsim led to the recommendation that inter-tactor spacing on a tactile vest should be at least 60 mm if the display is to be used for precise tactor localization. Finally, a GPS device was integrated into the tactile display. This allows appropriate navigational commands to be sent to the user through the tactile vest, based on information about the user's location.",

We accomplish this through an analysis-synthesis technique by combined perceptual and structural modeling of the musical surface, which leads to a minimal data representation. We introduce a music cognition framework that results from the interaction of psychoacoustically grounded causal listening, a time-lag embedded feature representation, and perceptual similarity clustering. Our bottom-up analysis intends to be generic and uniform by recursively revealing metrical hierarchies and structures of pitch, rhythm, and timbre. Training is suggested for top-down un-biased supervision, and is demonstrated with the prediction of downbeat. This musical intelligence enables a range of original manipulations including song alignment, music restoration, cross-synthesis or song morphing, and ultimately the synthesis of original pieces.",

Predictions of the saltation-abrasion model (Sklar and Dietrich, 2004) for sediment flux-dependent channel incision guide our efforts although the results are not model dependent. In channels where the dominant incision process is sediment abrasion, sediment transport and erosion are inherently coupled. Flume experiments support the form of sediment flux-dependent relations proposed in the saltation-abrasion model, but also suggest that the model is incomplete: channel bed morphology adjusts due to localized erosion, and bed morphology in turn influences local flow and sediment transport. The experiments document a positive feedback in which bedload is preferentially transported in local topographic lows due to lateral transport and abrasion in turn deepens those topographic lows. Under sediment-starved conditions this positive feedback results in the incision of narrow inner channels. In the Henry Mountains of southeast Utah, we monitored channel flow and resulting bedrock incision over 2.5 years in a human-perturbed bedrock channel where erosion had incised a narrow inner channel in which sediment transport and erosion were focused, similar to the flume experiments. In addition, the flow record shows that the maximum discharge flood was much less erosive than a lower but prolonged flood due to snowmelt flow. Large flash floods can be net depositors of coarse sediment in the channel, mantling the channel bed with coarse sediment and inhibiting erosion.(cont.) Finally, a quantitative comparison of tributaries in a Henry Mountains river network shows that channels with higher coarse sediment loads maintain steeper channel slopes and are less incised than smaller drainage area tributaries with less coarse sediment but more exposed bedrock. These field observations validate the idea that sediment cover can inhibit channel incision into bedrock, and also suggest that the slope of incising bedrock channels can adjust to transport the sediment load of the channel rather than to incise bedrock. We found in the flume experiments that erosion adjusts the morphology of bedrock channels until a state is reached where channel flow just transports the imposed sediment load, suggesting that the equilibrium state of bedrock channels is a transport-limited condition. Together, the chapters demonstrate how incising channels respond to changes in coarse sediment load, emphasizing the effects of sediment cover in inhibiting incision and morphological adjustments of channel bed topography.",

The first two problems, motivated by a major long distance provider, address capacity expansion in national hybrid long distance telecommunication networks that use both the traditional TDM technology and more recent VoIP technology to transport voice calls. While network capacity expansion in general is known to be hard to approximate, we exploit the unique requirements associated with hybrid networks to develop compact models and algorithms with strong performance guarantees for these problems. For a single period single facility capacity expansion problem in a hybrid network, using a decomposition approach we design a (2 + E)-factor approximation algorithm. Generalizing this idea, we propose a Decentralized Routing Scheme that can be used to design approximation algorithms for many variations of hybrid network capacity expansion. For the Survivable Capacity Expansion Problem in hybrid networks, in which we are required to install enough capacity to be able to support all demands even if a single link fails, we propose a compact integer program model. We show that this problem is APX-Hard, and present two heuristics with constant worst case performance guarantees. Finally, we consider the capacity planning problem when peak demands occurring at different times can share network capacity. We propose a general model for capturing time variation of demand, and establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a capacity plan to be feasible. Using a cutting plane approach, we develop a heuristic procedure. Computational experiments on real and random instances show that the proposed procedure performs well, producing solutions within 12% of optimality on average for the instances tested. The tests also highlight the significant savings potential that might be obtained by capacity planning with time sharing.",

Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

In particular, I predict and find that firms are able to react more quickly to negative economic shocks (by cutting investment and employment) than to positive economic shocks (where there is a lag in implementing new investments or expanding employment). Next, I create the link between real investment and operating decisions and accounting by examining properties of sales and cash sales. I focus on analyzing sales and cash sales because real investment and operating activities are likely to have a great impact on the timeliness and time-series properties of these variables. I hypothesize that due to the slow investment adjustment to positive shocks, sales will exhibit a relatively stronger sensitivity to negative versus positive shocks. I also predict that sales will reflect a positive shock over time (positive autocorrelation) whereas a negative shock will be reflected in sales in a more immediate and permanent fashion. I find strong empirical support for both predictions. Cross-sectional tests lend further support to my hypothesis that real operating and investment activities play a crucial role in determining the observed properties of accounting numbers.",

An understanding tongue structure and function, both under normal and pathological conditions, requires a complete three dimensional representation of fiber orientations present in the whole tissue. In order to investigate lingual myoarchitecture in the mammalian tongue, we employed several magnetic resonance imaging techniques generally based on direction specific differences in water diffusion. Muscle tissue in particular exhibits significant diffusion anisotropy in the direction of fibers, from which diffusion imaging is able to infer fiber direction. In this thesis research, several diffusion weighted MRI signal acquisition and post processing methods were tested, namely diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), DSI with tractography, q-ball imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and ADC and FA mapping. Each imaging method was evaluated in three ways: 1) finite element simulation using 2D structures to model the diffusion environment in an idealized situation, 2) MRI of microfluidic phantoms to quantify the effects of experimental conditions with a known diffusion environment, and 3) MRI of biological tissue, namely ex vivo cow and in vivo human tongues. The results demonstrated the capacity of DSI alone and in association with tractography to depict complex intravoxel and intervoxel fiber populations, in which a voxel is a 1-5 mm cubic imaged volume. In particular, our findings have identified and characterized on a structural basis a novel set of interwoven fiber populations.(cont.)

        "Abstrak": "Unmanned systems, such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), planetary rovers and space probes, have enormous potential in areas such as reconnaissance and space exploration. However the effectiveness and robustness of these systems is currently restricted by a lack of autonomy. Previous work introduced the concept of a model-based executive, which increases the level of autonomy, elevating the level at which systems are commanded. This simplifies the operator's task and leaves degrees of freedom in the plan that allow the executive to optimize resources and ensure robustness to uncertainty. Uncertainty arises due to uncertain state estimation, disturbances, model uncertainty and component failures. This thesis develops a model-based executive that reasons explicitly from a stochastic hybrid discrete-continuous system model to find the optimal course of action, while ensuring the required level of robustness to uncertainty is achieved. Our first contribution is a novel 'Particle Control' approach for robust execution of state plans with stochastic hybrid systems. We introduce the notion of chance-constrained state plan execution; this means that the executive ensures tasks in the state plan have at least a specified minimum probability of success. The minimum probabilities are specified by the operator, enabling conservatism to be traded against performance. In order to make optimal chance-constrained execution tractable, the Particle Control approach approximates the system's state distribution using samples or 'particles' and optimizes the evolution of these particles to achieve chance-constrained state plan execution. In this manner particle control solves a tractable deterministic approximation to the original stochastic problem; furthermore the approximation becomes exact as the number of particles approaches infinity.(cont.) For an important class of hybrid discrete-continuous system known as Jump Markov Linear Systems, the resulting deterministic optimization can be posed as a Mixed Integer Linear Program and solved to global optimality using efficient commercially-available solvers. Our second contribution is 'active' hybrid estimation subject to state plan constraints. Exact hybrid state estimation in stochastic hybrid systems is, in general, intractable. Tractable approximate hybrid estimation methods can lose track of the true hybrid state. In this thesis we develop an active hybrid estimation capability, which probes the system in order to reduce uncertainty in the hybrid state. This approach generates control sequences to minimize the probability of approximate hybrid estimation losing the true mode sequence, while ensuring that the state plan is satisfied subject to chance constraints. In order to make this problem tractable, we develop an analytic upper bound on the probability of losing the true mode sequence, and use a convex constraint tightening approach to approximate the chance constraints in the problem. Our final contribution is a novel hybrid model-learning approach. Specifying accurate hybrid system models is essential for accurate estimation and control, but is also extremely challenging. The hybrid executive must therefore determine hybrid system models from observed data. In this thesis we present an approximate Expectation-Maximization method for hybrid model learning; this method extends prior approaches to deal with mode transitions that depend on the continuous state.",

Multilayers assembled with a polymer anion and amine-modified silica nanoparticles were treated with salt solutions of monovalent and divalent cations. Refraction index of the films dropped significantly when treated with monovalent cations, and increased when treated with divalent cations. It has been found that the refraction index decrease in films treated with monovalent salts may be correlated with porosity increase in treated films, and this porosity increase in turn linked with an increase in hydrophilicity. Polyelectrolyte films have yet to show long-lasting antifogging properties on the commercially valuable polycarbonate, but monovalent cations may have improved the longevity of antifogging properties of the multilayer on polycarbonate, and warrant further study.",

        "Abstrak": "During the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process, a critical step in the manufacture of ultra-large-scale integrated (ULSI) semiconductor devices, undesirable nano-scale scratches are formed on the surfaces being polished. As the width of the interconnect Cu lines continues to shrink to below 60 nm, and as the traditional Si02 dielectric is replaced by the compliant, lowdielectric-constant materials, scratching has emerged as a challenging problem. This thesis presents a contact mechanics based approach for modeling nano-scale scratching by the hard abrasive particles in the slurry. Single-particle models that use elastic and plastic analyses to determine both the lower- and upper-bounds for the load per particle are introduced. These bounds are established for both homogenous and composite coatings. Multi-particle models are also presented. These models use contact mechanics at the pad-particle-coating interface to relate the global parameters of CMP, such as pressure, particle radius, slurry volume fraction and the material and geometrical properties of the pad and coating, to the widths and depths of scratches in the coatings. A lower- and upper-limit for the scratch width and depth in CMP is defined. Controlled indentation and scratching experiments have been conducted using a Hysitron TriboIndenter to validate the single-particle models. Based on these experiments, the upper-bound load per particle is used to predict the widths and depths of scratches in coatings. Furthermore, polishing experiments have been conducted using a CMP tool to validate the limits. The upper-limit for the semi-width of a scratch is equal to the product of the particle radius and the square root of the ratio of pad hardness to coating hardness. For a typical CMP pad and Cu coating, this upper-limit is one-fifth of the particle radius. Based on the models and the experiments, practical solutions for mitigating scratching in CMP, especially Cu CMP, are suggested.",

        "Abstrak": "The target subject of Natural Resources Planning (NRP) includes various systems and their elements, all of which are centered around the natural resource system. Given this characteristic complexity and a high degree of uncertainty, it is impossible to holistically understand the entire target system of NRP. Therefore, collecting the knowledge and experiences of all the stakeholders in all associated systems and then drawing a more adaptive agreement are regarded as the best method for dealing with this complexity and uncertainty. However, varying interests and values among stakeholders often lead to generation of deep conflicts and further prevent them from moving the process forward. The core problem lies in finding out how to reach consensus by managing conflicts arising from various group interactions; this necessitated the creation of appropriate heuristics with guidelines and framework. However, the current implementation of the appropriate and comprehensive heuristics like the Consensus Building approach faces various challenges regarding time and cost. In this thesis, I introduce the Decision Support System (DSS), which has previously been developed and utilized mainly in the management field, for providing a new platform for conducting a participatory process and facilitating the process by mitigating current challenges. I examined the various functions and aspects of multiple DSSs that could be beneficial to the process of NRP.(cont.) Moreover, along with advanced Information Technology, (1) various heuristic guidelines and framework designed to effectively and efficiently reap the benefits of collaboration and (2) system perspective methodologies that can give comprehensive insights across the system and be used to make stakeholder deliberations are closely examined. In particular, concerning the integrated features of DSS that could potentially be specialized for the NRP participatory process, diverse efforts to incorporate system perspective methodology with other analysis tools or to embed participatory heuristics in the IT platform are more rigorously investigated. The thesis discovered various overlapping areas among the three different areas of research and propose that these can be used in effectively arranging them for further collaboration in the development of the integrated DSS specialized for the participatory process in NRP (NRP-DSS). Finally, the thesis recommends a summarized list of the necessary conditions and challenges involved in developing NRP-DSS.",

        "Abstrak": "As the complexity and influence of engineering systems in modern society increases, so too does their potential to create counterintuitive and catastrophic accidents. Increasingly, the accidents encountered in these systems are defying the linearized notions of accident causality that-though developed for the simpler engineered systems of the past-are prevalently used for accident prevention today. In this dissertation, an alternative approach to accident prevention based on systems theory-the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) and STAMP-based hazard analysis (STPA)-is augmented with the notion of using phase space attractors to evaluate how well STAMP safety control structures enforce system safety constraints. Phase space attractors are mathematical results that emerge from the behavior of systems with dynamic structures that draw or constrain these systems to specific regions of their phase space in spite of a range of conditions. Accordingly, the goal in using this notion for the evaluation of safety constraint enforcement is to identify and analyze the attractors produced by a safety control structure to determine if it will adequately \"attract\" the system to safe states in spite of a range of unforeseeable conditions. Support for this approach to evaluating STAMP safety control structures is provided through the study of a safety control structure in an existing complex, socio-technical system. This case study is focused on a safety control process-referred to as Procedure Rework-used in Space Shuttle Mission Control to update procedures during in-flight operations as they are invalidated by changes in the state of the Space Shuttle and its environment.(cont.) Simulation models of procedure rework are developed through physical and human factors principles and calibrated with data from five Space Shuttle missions; producing simulation results with deviations from the historical data that are-as characterized by Theil Inequality Statistics-small and primarily due to cycles and noise that are not relevant to the models' purpose. The models are used to analyze the attractor produced by the Procedure Rework Process across varied conditions, including a notional crewed spacecraft mission to a distant celestial body. A detrimental effect in the process is identified-and shown to be potentially far more severe than light delay on a mission to a distant celestial body-and approaches to mitigating the effect are explored. Finally, the analysis conducted is described as a generalizeable process for using phase space attractors to evaluate system safety constraint enforcement in engineering systems.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, I investigate the response of a simple atmospheric general circulation model to applied forcings to learn whether the annular mode patterns are a preferred model response to the forcings. The thesis is inspired by the appearance of annular mode patterns in Earth's atmosphere in response to a number of forcings. Climatologies of the model under the influence of applied torques or perturbations to the reference temperature profile are compiled and compared to a control run with neither type of forcing. In most cases the differences in climatologies are annular mode-like, suggesting the patterns are the preferred response of the model to the forcings. The strength of the response typically increases for either an increase in the strength of the forcing, or an increase in the strength of the projection of the forcing on the model's annular mode patterns. Trials with a response which was not annular mode-like usually featured a poor projection of the forcing on the annular modes, or substantial interference with tropical dynamics. A zonally symmetric version of the model is also used to test the direct response of the model to the forcing versus the response caused by changes in eddy feedback processes. The direct forcing alone is found to be insufficient to produce either the correct strength or shape of the annular mode patterns. Instead the changes in eddy fluxes must be included to produce the correct shape and amplitude of the anomalies.",

The fluidity of the lipid bilayer would impart mobility to the signaling ligand. It was found that under appropriate substrate fabrication conditions, lipid bilayers and their associated ligand do segregate to the desired signaling patches. Additionally, the bilayer in these regions is fluid, and is potentially bioactive.

        "Abstrak": "In the second half of the twentieth century, American wildlife biologists incorporated Cold War-era surveillance technologies into their practices in order to render wild animals and their habitats legible and manageable. One of the most important of these was wildlife radio-tracking, in which collars and tags containing miniature transmitters were used to locate individual animals in the field. In addition to producing new ecological insights, radio-tracking served as a site where relationships among scientists, animals, hunters, animal rights activists, environmentalists, and others involved in wildlife conservation could be embodied and contested. While scholars have tended to interpret surveillance technologies in terms of the extension of human control over nature and society, I show how technological, biological, and ecological factors made such control fragmentary and open to reappropriation. Wildlife radio-tracking created vulnerabilities as well as capabilities; it provided opportunities for connection as well as for control. I begin by showing how biologists in Minnesota and Illinois in the early 1960s used radio-tracking to establish intimate, technologically-mediated, situated relationships with game animals such as ruffed grouse, which they hoped would bolster their authority vis-a-vis recreational hunters. I then show how the technique was contested by environmentalists when biologists applied it to iconic \"wilderness wildlife\" such as grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park in the 1960s and 1970s. One way for biologists to render radio-tracking acceptable in the face of such opposition was to emphasize its continuity with traditional practices, as they did in a radio-tagging study of tigers in Nepal in the 1970s.(cont.) Another way was to shift to less invasive techniques of remote sensing, such as the bioacoustic surveys of bowhead whales off Alaska's Arctic coast that were conducted in the 1980s after a proposal to radio-tag whales was rejected by marine mammalogists and Ifiupiat whalers. Finally, wildlife biologists could reframe radio-tracking as a means for popular connection rather than expert control, as they did by broadcasting the locations of satellite-tagged albatrosses to schoolchildren, gamblers, and the general public via the Internet in the 1990s and early 2000s.",

        "Abstrak": "A method will be described for finding the  shape of a smooth apaque object form a  monocular image, given a knowledge of the  surface photometry, the position of the  lightsource and certain auxiliary information to  resolve ambiguities. This method is  complementary to the use of stereoscopy  which relies on matching up sharp detail and  will fail on smooth objects. Until now the  image processing of single views has been  restricted to objects which can meaningfully  be considered two-dimensional or bounded  by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a  first-order non-linear partial differential  equation in two unknowns relating the  intensity at the image points to the shape of  the objects. This equation can be solved by  means of an equivalent set of five ordinary  differential equations. A curve traced out by  solving this set of equations for one set of  starting values is called a characteristic strip.  Starting one of these strips from each point on  some initial curve will produce the whole  solution surface. The initial curves can  usually be constructed around so-called  singular points. A number of applications of  this metod will be discussed including one to  lunar topography and one to the scanning  electron microscope. In both of these cases  great simplifications occur in the equations. A  note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative  theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An  implementation of some of these ideas on the  PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial intelligence  Laboratory will be described, and also a  nose-recognition program.",

The laws are stated in the context of the actor theory, a model for distributed parallel computation, and take the form of stating plausible restrictions on the histories of parallel computations to make them physically realizable. The laws are justified by appeal to physical intuition and are to be regarded as falsifiable assertions about the kinds of computations that occur in nature rather than as proven theorems in mathematics. The laws are used to analyze the mechanisms by which multiple processes can communicate to work effectively together to solve difficult problems.\r\nSince the causal relations among the events in a parallel computation do not specify a total order on events, the actor model generalizes the notion of computation from a sequence of states to a partial order of events. The interpretation of unordered events in this partial order is that they proceed concurrently. The utility of partial orders is demonstrated by using them to express our laws for distributed computation.",

The major theoretical goal of the research is to further develop a formal representation for teleological structure, called plans, which will facilitate both the abstract description of particular programs, and the compilation of a library of programming expertise in the domain of non-numerical computation. Adequacy of the theory will be demonstrated by implementing a system (to eventually become part of a LISP Programmer's Apprentice) which will be able to recognize various plans in LISP programs written by human programmers and thereby generate cogent explanations of how the programs work, including the detection of some programming errors.",

        "Abstrak": "Amorphous thermoplastic polymers are important engineering materials; however, their nonlinear, strongly temperature- and rate-dependent elastic-visco-plastic behavior has, until now, not been very well understood. The behavior has previously been modeled with mixed success by existing constitutive theories. As a result, there is currently no generally agreed upon theory to model the large-deformation, thermo-mechanically coupled, elasto-visco-plastic response of amorphous polymeric materials spanning their glass transition temperatures. What is needed is a unified constitutive framework that is capable of capturing the transition from a visco-elastic-plastic solidlike response below the glass transition temperature, to a rubbery-viscoelastic response above the glass transition temperature, to a fluid-like response at yet higher temperatures. We have developed a continuum-mechanical constitutive theory aimed to fill this need. The theory has been specialized to represent the salient features of the mechanical response of poly(methyl methacrylate) in a temperature range spanning room temperature to 60C above the glass transition temperature #g 110C of the material, in a strain-rate range of 10-4/s to 10-1/s, and under compressive stress states in which this material does not exhibit crazing. We have implemented our theory in the finite element program ABAQUS/Explicit. The numerical simulation capability of the theory is demonstrated with simulations of the micron-scale hot-embossing process for manufacture of microfluidic devices.",

        "Abstrak": "Nanoscale materials, including nanocrystals and carbon nanotubes, exhibit an appealing array of physical properties, and provide an interesting prospect for research both from a fundamental as well as a technological perspective. The current emerging themes in nanoscale research are: controlled synthesis with well defined sizes and geometries; unraveling their fundamental physical properties; and assembly of these nanoscale building blocks into functional devices. Although several approaches for producing the nanoparticles have been reported in the past decade, a general, large scale method for controlled synthesis of well-defined nanoparticles in the 1-5 nm size regimes is yet to be found. A general method that enables both syntheses of nanoparticles and their assembly on substrates is critical towards furthering technological applications. The work described here involved developing a method that utilized principles of self assembly in conjunction with inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry for the controlled synthesis of ordered arrays of nanocrystals. A unique attribute of this technique is it combined themes one and three, aforementioned, into a single step. First, uniform arrays of various mono- and hetero-bimetallic nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 1-5 nm were synthesized on various substrates using PS-P4VP block copolymer (BCP) templates. These arrays of monodisperse nanoparticles were employed as catalysts for the diameter-controlled growth of SWNTs.(cont.) Comparisons on their catalytic activities provided valuable insight on the catalyst-assisted growth of SWNTs. Alternate ways to improve the catalytic yield of nanotubes employing bi-metallic nanoparticles as well as novel catalysts for nanotube growth are also being reported for the first time. Importantly, a combinatorial approach involving BCPs and gas phase reactions was designed that enabled us in addressing some of the long standing problems associated with the syntheses of semiconductor III-Nitride nanocrystals. Finally, versatility of this synthesis method was further demonstrated by syntheses of ternary nitrides as well as rare earth ions doped GaN. While the investigations on the latter aspects are still in there infancy, initial results show significant promise and pave an exciting prospect for future studies.",

        "Abstrak": "Manipulation of the distribution of phonons inM a solid is important for both basic science and applications ranging from heat management to reduction of noise in electronic circuits and creating materials with superior acoustic and acousto-optical properties. This thesis explores hypersonic phononic crystals as means to achieve control over high frequency acoustic phonons. An integrated approach to fabrication, measurement and analysis of hypersonic phononic crystals with band gaps in the GHz range is presented. First, the phonon dispersion relation for one dimensional polymeric phononic crystals fabricated by coextrusion of a large number of poly(methylmethacrylate)/poly(carbonate) and poly(methylmethacrylate)/poly(ethylene terephthalate) bilayer pairs is investigated as a function of a lattice constant and composition using Brillouin light scattering and numerical simulations. This set of relatively simple multilayer structures represents an excellent platform to gain a basic understanding of phononic band gap phenomena. In addition, their in-plane phonon dispersion is used to extract information about the elastic constants and glass transition temperatures of individual nanolayers in a periodic multilayer arrangement. Next, two dimensional epoxy/air phononic crystals fabricated in a photoresist using interference lithography are studied. These structures are 2D single crystalline, enabling direction-resolved measurements of their phonon dispersion relation. As a result, the complete experimental phononic band diagram is obtained and correlated with numerical simulations. Finally, phononic properties of three dimensional elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) crystals are investigated and the mechanical tunability of their dispersion relation is demonstrated.(cont.) This set of structures forms the basis for understanding how to design and fabricate acoustic and acousto-optical devices with performance characteristics that can be adjusted dynamically during operation. The investigations described in this thesis demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that 1D, 2D and 3D periodic submicron structures have complex phonon dispersion relations at GHz frequencies. As a result, these crystals can be used to manipulate the flow of random thermal phonons as well as externally generated acoustic waves resulting in novel acoustic and thermal properties.",

        "Abstrak": "Asymmetric segregation of maternally-encoded proteins is essential to cell fate determination during early cell divisions of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) embryo, but little is known about the patterning of maternal transcripts inside somatic lineages. In the first Chapter of this thesis, by detecting individual mRNA molecules in situ, we measured the densities of the two maternal mRNAs pie-1 and nos-2 in non-germline cells. We find that nos-2 mRNA degrades at a constant rate in all somatic lineages, starting approximately 1 cell-cycle after each lineage separated from the germline, consistent with a model in which the germline protects maternal mRNAs from degradation. In contrast, the degradation of pie-1 mRNAs in one somatic lineage, AB, takes place at a rate slower than that of the other lineages, leading to an accumulation of that transcript. We further show that the 3' untranslated (UTR) region of the pie-1 transcript at least partly encodes the AB-specific degradation delay. Our results indicate that embryos actively control maternal mRNA distributions in somatic lineages via regulated degradation, providing another potential mechanism for lineage specification. The evolutionary fate of an allele ordinarily depends on its contribution to host fitness. Occasionally, however, genetic elements arise that are able to gain a transmission advantage while simultaneously imposing a fitness cost on their hosts. Seidel et al. previously discovered one such element in C. elegans that gains a transmission advantage through a combination of paternal-effect killing and zygotic self-rescue. In the second Chapter of this thesis we demonstrate that this element is composed of a sperm-delivered toxin, peel-1, and an embryo-expressed antidote, zeel-1. peel-1 and zeel-1 are located adjacent to one another in the genome and co-occur in an insertion/ deletion polymorphism. peel-1 encodes a novel four-pass transmembrane protein that is expressed in sperm and delivered to the embryo via specialized, sperm-specific vesicles. In the absence of zeel-1, sperm-delivered PEEL-1 causes lethal defects in muscle and epidermal tissue at the two-fold stage of embryogenesis. zeel-1 is expressed transiently in the embryo and encodes a novel six-pass transmembrane domain fused to a domain with sequence similarity to zyg-11, a substrate-recognition subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. zeel-1 appears to have arisen recently, during an expansion of the zyg-11 family, and the transmembrane domain of zeel-1 is required and partially sufficient for antidote activity. Although PEEL-1 and ZEEL-1 normally function in embryos, these proteins can act at other stages as well. When expressed ectopically in adults, PEEL-1 kills a variety of cell types, and ectopic expression of ZEEL-1 rescues these effects. Our results demonstrate that the tight physical linkage between two novel transmembrane proteins has facilitated their co-evolution into an element capable of promoting its own transmission to the detriment of the rest of the genome. The Apical Epidermal Ridge (AER) in vertebrates is essential to the outgrowth of a growing limb bud. Induction and maintenance of the AER reply heavily on the coordination and signaling between two surrounding cell types: ectodermal and mesenchymal cells. In morphogenesis during embryonic development, a process called the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs to transform epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells for increased cell mobility and decreased cell adhesion. To check whether the AER, which originated from the ectodermal layer, undergoes EMT for enhanced cell motility and invasiveness at an early stage of the limb outgrowth, we examined expression of biomarkers of the epithelial and mesenchymal cell types in the AER of a mouse forelimb at embryonic day 10.5 in Chapter three of this thesis. We also customized correlation-based image registration algorithm to perform image stitching for more direct visualization of a big field of tissue sample. We found that the AER surprisingly expresses both the epithelial marker and the mesenchymal marker, unlike a normal non-transitioning epithelial cell or a cell undergoing EMT. Our finding serves as a basis for potential future cell isolation experiments to further look into cell type switching of the AER and its interaction with the surrounding ectodermal and mesenchymal cells.",

Here, we report the identification of several MeCP2 phosphorylation sites in normal and epileptic brains from multiple species. We demonstrate that serine 80 (S80) phosphorylation of MeCP2 is critical as its mutation into alanine (S80A) in transgenic knock-in mice leads to locomotor deficits. S80A mutation attenuates MeCP2 chromatin association at several gene promoters in resting neurons and leads to transcription changes of a small number of genes. Calcium influx in neurons causes dephosphorylation at S80, potentially contributing to its dissociation from the chromatin. We postulate that phosphorylation of MeCP2 modulates its dynamic function in neurons transiting between resting and active states within neural circuits that underlie behaviors.",

Here we ask what drives the bloom of DDAs and present a simplified trait-based model of subtropical phototroph populations driven by observed, monthly averaged, environmental characteristics. The ratio of resource supply rates favors nitrogen fixation year round. The relative fitness of DDA traits is most competitive in early summer when the mixed layer is shallow, solar irradiance is high, and phosphorus and iron are relatively abundant. Later in the season, as light intensity drops and phosphorus is depleted, the traits of small unicellular diazotrophs become more competitive. The competitive transition happens in August, at the time when the DDA export event occurs. This seasonal dynamic is maintained when embedded in a more complex, global-scale, ecological model, and provides predictions for the extent of the North Pacific DDA bloom. The model provides a parsimonious and testable hypothesis for the stimulation of DDA blooms.",

Overexpression of human MSI2 in a mouse model increases HSC cell cycle progression and cooperates with the chronic myeloid leukemia–associated BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to induce an aggressive leukemia. MSI2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemia cell lines, and its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Expression levels in human myeloid leukemia directly correlate with decreased survival in patients with the disease, thereby defining MSI2 expression as a new prognostic marker and as a new target for therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).",

Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway.

Chapter 4 details the use of spacecraft image constraints in the orbit determination software GEODYN, which is used by NASA/GSFC for trajectory reconstruction and geophysical analyses of planets. Image constraints are shown to converge an orbit solution that differs from that computed by the Dawn Science Team at JPL by less than 13 m. Chapter 5 describes the application of the new technique in the estimation of the orientation parameters and low-degree gravity field of Vesta. The pole orientation and low-degree gravity field estimated agree with that presented by the Dawn Science Team through the use of an independent software and estimation algorithm.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis examines the market and functional aspects of developing a product portfolio architecture. Product use based market analysis of customer needs and product features is performed to determine the set of portfolio target values. The variation in these target values among and within customers is interpreted to yield a portfolio architecture recommendation for each feature. Correlation analysis is used to reduce the combinatorial complexity of target values according to market trends. Functional representation of a product portfolio is achieved through a monolithic function structure created by combining individual product use function structures. This function structure is partitioned into function clusters, representing potential module options, using a set of function modularity and variety modularity heuristics. The function modularity heuristics reveal relationships among the product functions according to the interconnection and causality of the functions. The variety heuristic, through which product features are mapped to the functions that deliver them, reveals the potential for variety-dependent modularity. The set of function clusters is compared to determine the degree of interaction among them. When variety function clusters are not orthogonal to each other, the portfolio architecture rules must be modified to compensate for this coupling, or portfolio variety will be compromised. An algorithm is used to reconcile interactions among the function clusters to maximize portfolio variety. The result is a set of function clusters for candidate product modules that achieves the best product variety given functional constraints. The process is exemplified using a portfolio of xerographic products.",

Cyclopentane (CyC5) hydrate has attracted interest as a model system for studying natural gas hydrates, because CyC5, like typical natural gas hydrate formers, is almost fully immiscible in water; and thus CyC5 hydrate formation is governed not only by thermodynamic phase considerations but also kinetic factors such as the hydrocarbon/water interfacial area, as well as mass and heat transfer constraints, as for natural gas hydrates. We present a macroscale investigation of the formation and adhesion strength of CyC5 hydrate deposits on bilayer polymer coatings with a range of wettabilities. The polymeric bilayer coatings are developed using initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) of a mechanically robust and densely cross-linked polymeric base layer (polydivinylbenzene or pDVB) that is capped with a covalently attached thin hydrate-phobic fluorine-rich top layer (poly(perfluorodecyl acrylate) or pPFDA). The CyC5 hydrates are formed from CyC5-in-water emulsions, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to confirm the thermal dissociation properties of the solid hydrate deposits. We also investigate the adhesion of the CyC5 hydrate deposits on bare and bilayer polymer-coated silicon and steel substrates. Goniometric measurements with drops of CyC5-in-water emulsions on the coated steel substrates exhibit advancing contact angles of 148.3 ± 4.5° and receding contact angles of 142.5 ± 9.8°, indicating the strongly emulsion-repelling nature of the iCVD coatings. The adhesion strength of the CyC5 hydrate deposits is reduced from 220 ± 45 kPa on rough steel substrates to 20 ± 17 kPa on the polymer-coated steel substrates. The measured strength of CyC5 hydrate adhesion is found to correlate very well with the work of adhesion between the emulsion droplets used to form the CyC5 hydrate and the underlying substrates.",

        "Abstrak": "The performance of a number of mechanical applications could be greatly improved by the introduction of transducers that are capable of exploiting the inherent power densities of piezoelectric materials. The ability of these solid-state materials to exert large forces at high frequencies engenders them with specific power levels (mass normalized) that are often several orders of magnitude greater than conventional transducers, but their utility is offset by their small achievable strains. A novel concept for a device capable of improved solid-state transduction, Micro Hydraulic Solid-State Transducers (MHSTs), is introduced and explored in this thesis. The concept is comprised of two core principles: ( 1) utilization of a hydraulic system consisting of a pump, valves, and a working fluid to rectify the high frequency reciprocations of a piezoelectric drive element into unidirectional motion, and (2) performance enhancement through miniaturization. The goal is a transducer possessing high power densities that is useful in conventional applications. Feasibility of the MHST concept is evaluated by designing, modeling, and simulating a prototype mechanism. The effects of miniattariza~ion on device performance are investigated and an optimal scale is determined. Concept feasibility is based on predicted system performance, existing issues, and manufacturing constraints. It is concluded that the concept is feasible and warrants further development.",

        "Abstrak": "Biological materials, such as proteins, often have a hierarchical structure ranging from basic building blocks at the nanoscale (e.g., amino acids) to assembled structures at the macroscale (e.g., fibers). Current software for materials engineering allows the user to specify polypeptide chains and simple secondary structures prior to molecular dynamics simulation, but is not flexible in terms of the geometric arrangement of unequilibrated structures. Given some knowledge of a larger-scale structure, instructing the software to create it can be very difficult and time-intensive. To this end, the present paper reports a mathematical language, using category theory, to describe the architecture of a material, i.e., its set of building blocks and instructions for combining them. While this framework applies to any hierarchical material, here we concentrate on proteins. We implement this mathematical language as an open-source Python library called Matriarch. It is a domain-specific language that gives the user the ability to create almost arbitrary structures with arbitrary amino acid sequences and, from them, generate Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. In this way, Matriarch is more powerful than commercial software now available. Matriarch can be used in tandem with molecular dynamics simulations and helps engineers design and modify biologically inspired materials based on their desired functionality. As a case study, we use our software to alter both building blocks and building instructions for tropocollagen, and determine their effect on its structure and mechanical properties.",

All probable early-polymerized 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers, ranging from dimers to tetramers, have been systematically analyzed to find the most stable geometry connections as well as to propose a set of molecular models that represents the chemically diverse nature of PDA and eumelanin. Our results indicate that more planar oligomers have a tendency to be more stable. This finding is in good agreement with recent experimental observations, which suggested that PDA and eumelanin are composed of nearly planar oligomers that appear to be stacked together via π–π interactions to form graphite-like layered aggregates. We also show that there is a group of tetramers notably more stable than the others, implying that even though there is an inherent chemical diversity in PDA and eumelanin, the molecular structures of the majority of the species are quite repetitive. Our results also suggest that larger oligomers are less likely to form. This observation is also consistent with experimental measurements, supporting the existence of small oligomers instead of large polymers as main components of PDA and eumelanin. In summary, this work brings an insight into the controversial structure of PDA and eumelanin, explaining some of the most important structural features, and providing a set of molecular models for more accurate modeling of eumelanin-like materials.",

But the County continues to be developed into residential subdivisions. This thesis explores the inconsistency in the perspectives and actions of residents regarding farmland preservation and development. Contrary to what you might expect, those in the County who want to preserve farmland and those who are developing the land are often the same people. Individuals talk about the importance of saving farmland, even though they just bought a home that was built on what was an active farm. Farmers, who have a deep connection with the County's land and know its importance, choose to develop their farms. It's not a complete mystery as to why this is happening, but it is a wonder how these individuals deal with their personal inconsistencies. How do such individuals confront the inconsistencies that they face? Furthermore, how do they justify their actions regarding the development of farmland? How do these groups of people as individuals see themselves in relation to the conflict between farmland preservation and development? Are they simply ambivalent?(cont.) In an attempt to find out, I interviewed Lancaster County residents in two locations in the County where a farm had been developed into their single family homes. The farmer owners/developers were interviewed as well. The interviewees respond in numerous ways, but they all expressed a desire for balance. They support farmland preservation efforts, but they also believe that growth is necessary. This \"balance\" is how they expressed their ambivalence towards the subject. The interviews showed specific ways that information can enlighten the balance between development and farmland preservation. The County government is encouraged to take on the provision of information as a tool of intervention in this area. An informed public can then make better choices as to what the \"balance\" will look like. Local governments are responsible for implementing this balance by using zoning to control and direct development away from the County's agricultural land. Coordinated action in the County is required to avoid the County's farming character tragically disappearing.",

        "Abstrak": "This study is about the impact of decentralization in metropolitan areas. Studies of fiscal decentralization have largely centered on the formal tiers of government, without looking at the effects of this process on the recipient jurisdictions in metropolitan areas. This is an important omission, considering that more than 50 percent of the world's population lives in urban areas that often extend beyond formal jurisdictional boundaries. As a response, in this study I incorporate the metropolitan dimension into the study of fiscal decentralization. After integrating a database with information on the public finances of the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico (ZMVM), I test the hypothesis that the policies of fiscal decentralization in Mexico have exacerbated the level of fiscal disparity in this metropolitan area. My results show that fiscal disparity in the ZMVM increased during the 1990s. Fiscal decentralization had two different and opposite effects on fiscal disparities in the ZMVM. On one hand, fiscal decentralization mitigated fiscal disparities through the use of a system of redistributive transfers. On the other, and in contrast to this equalizing effect, decentralization has exacerbated the level of fiscal disparity by accentuating the differences of the jurisdictions' expenditure needs and their capacity to collect local taxes.(cont.) In particular, this research shows that despite state intervention through a system of redistributive transfers, the increase in fiscal disparities was due to three primary factors: the indirect effect of transfers on local fiscal effort, the uneven distribution of services and infrastructure in the metropolitan space, and differing governance structures in the ZMVM's jurisdictions. Due to the negative effects of fiscal disparities on urban segregation and poverty, I recommend two policy alternatives to mitigate fiscal fragmentation in the ZMVM: the creation of a metropolitan fund and the formation of a special authority for the transportation sector.",

        "Abstrak": "Now a permanently protected type of open space, the community gardens in Boston's South End began in the early 1970's as an effort to utilize vacant land in what was a predominantly low-income neighborhood. Since then, the South End has experienced steady gentrification and is now one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Boston. Despite these changes, the South End, due in part to its substantial supply of subsidized housing, has retained residents with a mix of income levels and is a neighborhood that is still known for its diversity. Much of the previous literature on the role and value of community gardens has focused primarily on low-income communities, and there has been little research on community gardens in gentrifying or similarly changing neighborhoods. The South End, therefore, is an ideal arena in which to investigate the past development and present-day role of community gardens in a changing neighborhood. This thesis examines the role of the South End's community gardens both as places in and of themselves and as part of the larger urban landscape and community.(cont.) By taking the perspective of the community in the garden and the garden in the community, the study explores both the dynamics of the smaller communities within the gardens and their role as a unique type of open space in the larger neighborhood and community that surrounds them. Through in-depth interviews as well as archival and observational methods, it traces the historical development of a community garden movement in the South End and also examines the specific present-day dynamics of two case study gardens. The research finds that these community gardens reflect the qualities and dynamics of the surrounding neighborhood, both in terms of its positive diversity as well as its conflicts and tensions. Furthermore, community gardens are places where these qualities are uniquely engaged through the interaction of people of different backgrounds by means of their common interest in gardening. Finally, the community gardens hold unique value for non-gardeners both as open space and as gardens, and provide lessons for the potential benefits of developing and maintaining new community gardens elsewhere.",

        "Abstrak": "With the rise of 'Mobile 2.0,' digital telecommunications are beginning to provide deep resources of information to mobile city dwellers. Particularly striking among recent applications is placelogging, defined here as the practice of digitally annotating physical places with user-generated text and media accessible onsite to other mobile users. Placelogging presents potential as a means of engaging citizens with each other and with their environment, as well as distributing authority over defining what Kevin Lynch called \"the image of the city.\" But as an emerging practice, its uniqueness as a mode of communication distinct from other forms of spatial annotation has not yet been proved. To investigate the uniqueness of placelogging, the thesis first establishes a taxonomy of spatial annotation through which to consider the different forms, functions, and trends in official adoption of a wide range of annotating media. Next, annotations made through various media, including placelogging projects [murmur] and Yellow Arrow, are catalogued in two neighborhoods each of Toronto and New York City. A preliminary methodology is defined to analyze and compare trends in distribution, placement and content of annotations.(cont.) Placelogs are found to distinguish themselves by annotating a wide range of public and private places, identified as what Margaret Crawford calls the 'everyday space' of city residents, with predominantly subjective, first-person content, which is described as marking 'everyday time.' Participant interviews and research on related technologies are used to support claims that placelogging could be used to identify sites of shared meaning in the city as well as to foster place attachment, claim to space and social connections among participants. Uses in community development are considered through three cases of implementation: [murmur] in Toronto, Yellow Arrow in Copenhagen and Proboscis' Urban Tapestries in London. Uses for revealed meanings are proposed in preservation, identification of development priorities and sensitivity of response in urban development. Lynch's visual image of the city is revisited as a 'meaning image' that encourages design practices of 'interactive ethnography' and 'sometimes' urban design. Finally, unfamiliarity with and differential access to technology are considered in the context of public uses for placelogging and its derived data.",

        "Abstrak": "In this dissertation I examine the change in youths' sense of urban and non-urban places brought about by involvement in a multi-site agriculture program. The concept of 'Place' is more than the biophysical and built settings in a defined space; it also includes the human meanings and values associated with these locations. How a place is experienced is often referred to as sense of place, which may be defined broadly as the collection of meanings, beliefs, symbols, values, and feelings that individuals or groups associate with a particular locality. The literature in this area comes from a broad range of disciplines, including geography, environmental psychology, sociology and anthropology. It has also entered the lexicon of a diversity of practitioners, including environmental educators, urban planners, architects, and real estate developers. Its broad use suggests that these concepts resonate with a wide spectrum of scholars and practitioners. Surprisingly, little has been written about the sense of place among youth (either with reference to their home environment or in relation to other places that they may or may not have directly experienced). Similarly, little is known about the processes by which a sense of place develops.(cont.) My research begins to fill these gaps through an in-depth, multi-year case study of youth who participated in a two-month agriculture program with The Food Project (together with a control group of non-participating: youth). The Food Project is a Boston-based organization that brings together non-urban and inner city youth to work together on organic farms located in Lincoln (a wealthy, predominantly White town outside of Boston) and Roxbury (a predominantly Black and Hispanic, low-income inner city neighborhood of Boston). Unlike many racial integration programs that bring youth of color from the city out to the suburbs where they have contact with White, suburban peers (such as school busing programs), all participants in The Food Project experience intense contact with peers from different backgrounds in both familiar and unfamiliar environments. The Food Project program can be thought of as an accelerated version of more mundane place experience; without the focused intervention that this program provided, repeated exposures to new, non-residential places tend to occur over a longer period of time than the two months spent with The Project. Studying an accelerated place experience such as that enabled by The Food Project's Summer Program provides a window into how youth develop relationships to places over longer periods of time.(cont.) I draw upon a mixed method design to examine the question: How do non-urban and urban youth sense places and how is this changed through a place-based integration program? The data that I utilize comes from semi-structured interviews, surveys, cognitive mapping exercises and participant observation. The final method was particularly useful in garnering an understanding of the development of the youths' place perceptions. Embedded as a fellow 'crew worker' for a two-month period, I observed and recorded the youths' actions and attitudes toward places. My intense daily contact with the young people provided insights into the factors that impacted the way in which they sensed Lincoln, Roxbury and their home environments that cannot be captured through standardized measures, such as surveys and questionnaires. My mixed methods approach provided a rich data set that affords an opportunity to compare the sense of places of urban and non-urban youth as well as the changes produced by this program. Although the sense of places of the youth in this study reflected their individually unique identities, values and social skills, the results of my research led to the development of a general framework that has utility to guide future research questions in this area.(cont.) This framework includes the mediating variable I call place repertoires and two moderating variables, environmental fit, and cross place friendships. A place repertoire refers to an individual's lived and virtual experiences in a set of places. In making assessments or discussing places, all of the youth drew on their repertoires, mentally comparing and contrasting features of places with one another. The expansion of a youth's repertoire resulted in sharper images and the ability to see subtle variations across places. The effect of an increased repertoire was moderated by the youth's environmental fit, which refers to the alignment of their personal identity with their local environs. The strength of the relationships that they formed with their peers who resided in places different from their own also moderated the impact of an expanded repertoire on their sense of a given environment. Outcomes of particular interest included the association between the non-urban youths' expanded repertoires and their increased use of racial indicators in place discussions. This shift in language represented a convergence in the urban and non-urban youths' place talk. Another notable observation was the variation in the youths' tendency to reimage Roxbury through the historical interpretive frame that was presented to them by The Food Project.(cont.) Youth who started the program with broader place repertoires consistently reframed their image through a historical lens, while their peers with narrower repertoires did not. I hypothesize that the former group's larger initial place literacy facilitated the development of a more complex image and understanding of Roxbury. Both of these results highlight the important role that planning practitioners can play in fostering a shared understanding and vision of places amongst their constituents. This dissertation moves the sense of place literature beyond a vague description of what is being sensed (and what goes unsensed) by youth from different backgrounds, and provides a greater understanding of the similarities and differences in how youth sense these places. This information is of great importance to urban planners, community organizers and environmental educators with interests in developing strategies for engaging youth in the stewardship of their environments. The results are also relevant for scholars, planners and decision makers interested in how people in a diverse and segregated society develop a racialized sense of places.(cont.) My hope is that this work will encourage planners to look beyond the traditional sense of place literature that emphasizes 'natural' environments, home, and what I argue is a romanticized notion of the positive relationship between time spent in a place and one's sense of that place. The results of my research indicate that there is a need to consider an individual's attributes, such as race, class, biases and stereotypes, in understanding how people develop their sense of a given place. These variables are traditionally the domain of sociologists who often deal in placeless units, such as census tracts. As planners we should 'emplace' these variables in order to unveil their meaning for the way in which people experience their environments.",

        "Abstrak": "With the environmental crisis involving climate change fast approaching, all potential mitigation techniques must be explored and implemented. A key approach comes from the power towns and cities have to influence land use and building standards in their jurisdiction. This thesis uses a scenario planning approach to explore the energy implications of four potential futures for the town of Littleton, MA. Four scenario storylines (Business as Usual (BAU), Baby Steps (high residential density, no mixing), Mixed Use Village (higher residential density, mixed uses), and Thoroughly Green (similar to Mixed Use Village with added green building requirements)) were used to frame the potential outcomes. Typical development typologies from nearby Massachusetts towns served as proxies for the scenarios. Using an elasticity method based on the density, diversity and design of the typologies, the reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for each alternative scenario as compared to the BAU scenario was calculated and used to determine the reduction in gasoline usage and CO2 emissions. Local and regional average electricity and heating values were used to calculate the home energy consumption for each scenario.(cont.) The Baby Steps and Mixed Use Village/Thoroughly Green scenarios reduced VMT by 14% and 32%, respectively. The Baby Steps scenario used 45% less electricity, the Mixed Use Village used 55% less, and the Thoroughly Green scenarios used 65% less than the BAU scenario. The annual cost savings per capita from the above energy savings run from $321 to $737 for transportation and CO2 reduction, and $242 to $408 for housing energy consumption. The total savings per capita run from $563-$1,145. The total savings for the hypothetical development are $1.2 million to $2.4 million. Policy makers should take the results of this scenario analysis to support the inclusion of energy implications in land use planning. Recommended measures include requiring an energy section in master plans, providing state-wide technical support for these plans, supporting processes to incorporate energy considerations in public planning processes, and funding for further research into the quantification of the energy land use connection and what steps towns can take to address it.",

        "Abstrak": "A density bonus, also called incentive zoning, is a conditional liberalization of zoning regulations, allowing a real estate development to exceed as-of-right density limits in exchange for the in-kind provision or purchase of a public amenity, often affordable housing or public open space. I explore employing LEED certification, an increasingly well-known proxy for environmental quality, as the density bonus amenity. In theory, the idea is to link profitable real estate development with environmental sustainability. In practice, my primary interest is in the tradeoffs between the perceived burdens of greater density and the potential benefits of enhanced environmental quality. I begin by examining the economic, public policy, and legal underpinnings of the density bonus idea, followed by a consideration of bonus calibration methods in current use, and determine that none adequately accounts for the public's valuation of density bonus amenities. In response, I explore the applicability of public valuation methods employed in the fields of environmental and real estate economics, before turning to scholarship on public participation for guidance. In the second section, with the fundamentals of incentive zoning better defined, I add LEED to the mix.(cont.) Employing LEED as a bonus amenity/public benefit has the potential to yield, I argue, a closer alignment of the benefits and burdens of development by reducing the local, regional, and global environmental impacts of buildings. This promise, however, is realizable only with an appropriate deliberative process. To place my proposal in context, as well as introduce some of the many real world difficulties it would undoubtedly encounter, I examine a hypothetical LEED Density Bonus tailored to Boston's Fenway neighborhood and Boston's existing zoning and development review procedures. My specific target is the under-utilized, auto-oriented upper Boylston Street corridor, which has long been viewed as a planning challenge by the city and a burden by the adjacent Fenway neighborhood. I conclude by visually simulating the build-out of three different LEED bonus scenarios on Boylston Street.",

The intent is two-fold: to inform non-profit project sponsors about strategies leading to low-cost outcomes, and to advocate for policies that promote such low-cost outcomes. The impacts of the players in LIHTC deals, Massachusetts state policy, the original capital structure, and legal partnership arrangements on the strategies that non-profit owners can pursue to maintain control of tax credit properties are considered. Specific outcomes described include bargain sale and charitable contribution, debt-plus-taxes or right of first refusal, and transfer of the limited partnership interest. Themes include the tension between for- and non-profit partners, public and private interests, and federal and state policies. Because the LIHTC is administered on a state-by-state basis, the Massachusetts regulatory environment and state housing resources play a central role in shaping disposition outcomes in the Commonwealth.(cont.) This thesis looks at how the recent lack of recapitalization funding for LIHTC properties has revealed an opportunity for the Commonwealth to improve the existing HUD preservation paradigm. Massachusetts' previous policies and current political environment create an opportunity for the state to promote new model of preservation that breaks from the federal paradigm of prodigal public payments to investors. I recommend that the Commonwealth prevents original, private investors from receiving additional public subsidy at the back end of LIHTC deals by separating the disposition and recapitalization of properties.",

        "Abstrak": "A human mission to Mars will be physically demanding and presents a variety of medical risks to crew members. It has been recognized for over a century that loading is fundamental for bone health, and that reduced loading, as in prolonged bed rest or space flight, leads to bone loss. Osteocytes, the most abundant bone cell type, are thought to be key mechanical sensors in bone, yet the molecular mechanism of this action remains poorly understood. Improved understanding of how osteocytes regulate skeletal responses to mechanical loading and unloading could have significant implications for treatment of bone disorders related to disuse or immobilization. Thus, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies on osteocytes exposed to unloading to investigate their role in disuse and microgravity-induced bone loss. Specifically, we generated and characterized a novel osteocytic cell line that recapitulates the response to hormonal and mechanical stimuli of osteocytes in vivo. This novel cell line provided the first evidence of a cell-autonomous increase in sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of Wntsignaling, following exposure to simulated microgravity. These cells were also used for a spaceflight mission after demonstrating their ability to maintain an osteocytic phenotype when cultured in a fully automated flight-certified system. Finally, we utilized murine models of unloading to show that pharmacologic inhibition of sclerostin induces bone formation and prevents disuse-induced bone loss.",

        "Abstrak": "This work is dedicated to studying the effects of synthetic CRUD (Chalk River Unidentified Deposits) on pool and subcooled flow boiling parameters. Previous pool boiling studies have demonstrated the potential of porous, hydrophilic surfaces to lead to more efficient boiling. CRUD is a naturally occurring porous, hydrophilic layer that forms on fuel rods during reactor operation. As such, CRUD deposition may have large effects on critical heat flux (CHF) and heat transfer coefficient (HTC). An investigation of such effects was conducted as part of the CASL project by creating well-defined and characterized synthetic CRUD with parameters representative of reactor CRUD on indium tin oxide-sapphire heaters. The effects of synthetic CRUD on boiling heat transfer were then experimentally studied, focusing on heat transfer coefficient (HTC), critical heat flux (CHF), nucleation site density, bubble departure frequency, and bubble departure diameter. These heaters were tested in pool and flow boiling facilities in MIT's Reactor Hydraulics Laboratory. Synthetic CRUD was created using layer-by-layer deposition of 100 nm silica nanoparticles to form porous, hydrophilic thick films. Photolithography was used to manufacture posts that were then dissolved to create characteristic boiling chimneys. Features such as thickness, wettability, pore size, and chimney diameter and pitch were verified to be representative of reactor CRUD. Silica nanoparticles were used as a surrogate for reactor CRUD nanoparticle materials (iron and nickel oxides) since they create more stable films. To ensure accurate modeling, independent of material, 10 nm silica nanoparticle and 10 nm iron oxide nanoparticle boiling tests were conducted and found to be similiar. During testing, IR thermography and high-speed video (HSV) are used to obtain two dimensional temperature profiles of the active heater area to quantify properties such as HTC, nucleation site density, bubble departure frequency, and bubble departure diameter. The bubble parameters follow expected trends with mass flux and heat flux. IR/HSV flow data (Chapter 6) has shown that HTC increases with the presence of chimneys, increasing thickness and increasing chimney diameter. However the HTC is relatively unaffected by the chimney pitch and is decreased by the presence of an LbL layer. The boiling curves and CHF data obtained from pool boiling experiments with iron oxide and silica oxide nanoparticles with and without chimneys also confirm these trends. The largest HTC is observed in the case of uncoated heaters, followed by heaters with chimneys, with heaters with an LbL layer without chimneys having the lowest HTC. From pool boiling data, the benefit of a CRUD layer is observed in the enhancement of CHF. The flow boiling trends are further supported by the combination of measured basic bubble parameters according to the heat flux partitioning model. The statistical significance of these trends varies with mass flux. The data generated here may inform advanced models of boiling heat transfer and/or validate existing models.",

        "Abstrak": "Active matter systems have very recently received a great deal of interest due to their rich emergent non-equilibrium behavior. Some of the most vital and ubiquitous biological systems and processes are active matter systems including reproduction, wound healing, dynamical adaptation, chemotaxis, and cell differentiation. Active matter systems span multiple length scales from meter to nanometer and can vary depending on the shape of the active agent, mode of motility, and environment. However, active matter systems are unified in that they are all composed of active units or particles that continuously convert ambient, stored, or chemical energy locally into motion and exhibit emergent non-equilibrium collective dynamical or phase behavior. Active matter systems have been studied extensively in the biological context, as well as in simulation and theory. However, there are relatively few artificial or synthetic experimental model soft active matter systems that can effectively mimic the rich emergent behavior exhibited by many active matter systems. Such model experimental systems are crucial not only to confirm the exotic behavior predicted by theoretical and simulation systems, but to study and investigate the underlying physical phenomenon which may contribute to or even drive some emergent phenomenon. These model systems are crucial to help determine what behavior is due to purely physical phenomenon and what behavior requires some type of biological or biochemical stimuli. In this thesis, I will develop several artificial experimental model active matter systems that are able to effectively mimic and reproduce some of the rich emergent non-equilibrium behavior exhibited by several active matter systems or processes, like chemotaxis, in order to uncover the underlying physical phenomenon that govern this emergent behavior. I will start by designing an extremely simple active matter system composed of a single active unit and then build up in complexity by adding many active components, changing the mode of motility, and including passive components which may or may not be fixed. I will show in this thesis that this emergent behavior is guided by fundamental physical phenomenon like friction and the mechanical properties of the environment. The thesis divides this study into two Parts. In Part I, I will develop an artificial soft active matter system that is able to effectively perform chemotaxis in a non-equilibrium manner by leveraging the concept of effective friction. The active component in this system will be magnetic particles that are coated with a biological ligand or receptor and placed on a substrate with the corresponding ligand or receptor. A rotating magnetic field will be applied and the magnetic particle will proceed to rotate with the applied field and convert some of that rotational energy into translational energy due to the effective friction induced by the breaking of reversible bonds between the surface of the particle and the substrate. I will then create gradients in the density of such binding sites and by placing the magnetic particle on a stochastic, random walk the differences in effective friction will lead to directed motion or drift reminiscent of chemotaxis. I will show that this concept of sensing based on effective friction induced by a binding interaction is general and scales with the affinity of the interaction being investigated (i.e. protein-lipid, metal ion, electrostatic, antigen-antibody, or hydrophobic interactions). In Part II, I will build up in complexity and develop an artificial soft active matter system consisting of two active units embedded in a dense passive matrix in order to mimic the emergent behavior of many biological systems composed of both active and passive components. In this system, an ultra-long range attractive interaction emerges due to a combination of activity and the mechanical properties of the dense passive media. The range of the interaction can be tuned by changing the level of activity, the actuation protocol, the mode of motility, the composition of the dense passive monolayer, and the concentration of active units. Alternatively, if the passive components are fixed to the substrate, the active components undergo a disorder induced delocalization and exhibit super-diffusive transport properties. On the basis of these results, I propose several guidelines to developing novel artificial soft active matter systems which bear future investigation. The findings in this thesis represent a comprehensive study of the exotic emergent non-equilibrium behavior exhibited by many active matter systems by developing novel artificial experimental soft model active matter systems. These novel model experimental systems revealed some underlying fundamental physical phenomenon that contribute to some of the non-equilibrium behavior observed in the biological system of interest. These results may generalize not only to other simulation or theoretical active matter systems but potentially to biological systems as well. This work will be essential not only in guiding the design of future artificial experimental soft active matter systems, but can also be extended towards designing hybrid artificial-biological soft active matter systems.",

        "Abstrak": "Agility is defined as the ability to quickly change speed or direction. Planned agility refers to the physical act of changing direction and reactive agility addresses the additional cognitive responses needed to react quickly to an external cue. This work specifically considers reactive agility. Agility performance is often evaluated using time-based metrics, which provide little information about which factors aid or limit success. Two studies were completed to identify key factors contributing to agility performance. The objective of the first study was to determine how novices and experts working in athletic, clinical, and military environments qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate agility performance. Thirty-three participants completed a survey which involved scoring 16 athletes on a 7 point Likert scale of not agile to agile. The spread of the scores indicated that even within groups, participants had different opinions about which aspects of technique contributed to high performance. Participant responses were used to link several terms to agility technique. The objective of the second study was to apply these terms to the development of objective biomechanical metrics. An array of body-worn inertial sensors was used to calculate metrics that were sensitive to performance speed. Five metrics were defined (normalized number of foot contacts, stride length variance, arm swing variance, mean normalized stride frequency, and number of body rotations). Eighteen participants donned 13 sensors to complete a reactive agility task, which involved navigating a set of cones in response to a vocal cue. Participants were grouped into fast, medium, and slow performance based on their completion time. Participants in the fast group had the smallest number of foot contacts after normalizing by height, highest stride length variance, highest forearm angular velocity variance, and highest stride frequency after normalizing by height.These metric values translate to an efficient strategy for making turns by minimizing path length between cues and cones, effectively adjusting stride in reaction to turn points, and using tight pumping arm motions to aid in accelerating out of endpoint cones.The results of this study have the potential to inform the development of a composite agility score constructed from the list of significant metrics. Study 1 informed the quantification of qualitative agility terminology and Study 2 mapped these terms to speed of performance. The outcomes from these studies can assist in strategy development for training and rehabilitation across athletic, clinical, and military domains.",

        "Abstrak": "The transport theory of high-intensity elliptic charged-particle beams is presented. In particular, the halo formation and beam loss problem associated with the high space charge and small-aperture structure is addressed, and a novel transport theory of large-aspect-ratio elliptic beams has been developed. In a small-aperture system image-charge effects have been found to be a new mechanism for inducing chaotic particle motion, halo formation and beam loss. The rms envelope equations have been derived and analyzed for unbunched intense charged-particle beams in an alternating-gradient focusing field and a cylindrical metal pipe. Numerical results have shown that for vacuum phase advance ao < 90°, the higher-order image-charge effects on the matched and slightly mismatched beam envelopes are negligibly small for all beams with arbitrary beam density profiles (including hollow density profiles) as well as for arbitrary small apertures (including beams with large aspect ratios). However, the main unstable region for the envelope evolution with image-charge effects, which occurs for 90: < a, < 270', depending on the value of the normalized beam intensity SKI e, has been found to be narrower than its counterpart without image-charge effects.(cont.) Using the test-particle model it has been shown that in a small-aperture alternating-gradient focusing channel, image-charge effects induce chaotic particle motions and halo formation in intense charge-particle beams. This mechanism occurs for well-matched beams with the ideal Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (KV) distribution. The halo formation and beam loss are sensitive to system parameters: the quadruple focusing field filling factor, the vacuum phase advance, the perveance and the pipe radius. As shown in our parametric studies, the beam loss increases rapidly as the perveance of the beam increases and as the pipe radius decreases. In addition, a self-consistent PIC simulation code, Periodically Focused Beam (PFB2D), has been developed, and used to simulate intense charged-particle beams in small-aperture alternating-gradient systems. PIC simulation results on the beam envelope are consistent with the envelope equation'solutions. However, due to numerical noise in PIC simulations, the beam loss predicted by PIC simulation has been found to be an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by the test-particle model.(cont.) To analyze the noise in PIC simulations, an error scaling law for the edge emittance growth and particle diffusion due to the discrete macro-particle effects has been derived for self-consistent intense beam simulations. The error scaling law has been tested in the self-consistent Green's function simulations and self-consistent PIC PFB2D simulations. The simulation results have shown good agreement with the scaling law. Novel exact paraxial cold-fluid and Vlasov equilibria have been found for a high-intensity, space-charge-dominated charged-particle beam with a periodically twisted elliptic cross section in a non-axisymmetric periodic magnetic field. Generalized envelope equations, which determine the beam envelopes, ellipse orientation, density, and internal flow velocity profiles, have been derived, and solved numerically for nonrelativistic and relativistic examples of such beams. The equilibrium and stability of such beams have been demonstrated by self-consistent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. For current applications, the temperature effects are found to be small on a periodically twisted large-aspect-ratio elliptic beam.(cont.) We anticipate that the equilibrium theory will provide a valuable tool in the design of high-intensity elliptic beams in novel vacuum electron devices, especially for ribbon-beam klystrons (RBKs) and ribbon-beam traveling-wave amplifiers (RBA). The ellipse-shaped beam equilibria may provide some flexibility in the design and operation of high-intensity accelerators.",

        "Abstrak": "We present theoretical and experimental results from a Smith-Purcell radiation experiment using the electron beam from a 17 GHz high gradient accelerator. Smith- Purcell radiation occurs when a charged particle travels above a periodic grating structure. The electron beam consists of a train of 15 MeV, 9 pC bunches of bunch lengths varying from 600 fs to 1 ps. The radiated energy for one electron travelling above a periodic grating is solved. The effects of multiple electrons in a bunch and multiple bunches in a train are introduced. The Smith-Purcell resonance condition and the dependence of the radiated energy upon beam current and beam height above the grating are presented. Measurement of the angular distribution of the Smith- Purcell radiation resulted in bunch length measurements of 0.60 ± 0.1 ps and 1 ± 0.1 ps under different accelerator operating conditions. This demonstrates the use of Smith-Purcell radiation as a non-destructive bunch length diagnostic with 100 fs resolution. Smith-Purcell radiation is comparable to other sources of radiation, such as transistion radiation, synchrotron radiation, etc. except that it has an inherent enhancement by a factor of Ng, the number of grating periods. Additional enhancement occurs when the electron bunch length is short compared with the radiation wavelength, resulting in coherent emission with an enhancement by a factor of Ne the number of electrons in the bunch. Finally, the electron beam consists of a regular train of Nb bunches, resulting in an energy density spectrum that is restricted in frequency space to harmonics of the bunch train frequency, with an increase in the energy density at these frequencies by a factor of Nb.(cont.) We report the first observation of Smith-Purcell radiation displaying all three of these enhancements, that is, with a total enhancement of Ng.Ne.Nb. This total enhancement provides a simple method of generating powerful THz radiation at specific frequencies, which can be detected with a high signal to noise ratio by a heterodyne receiver.",

        "Abstrak": "The fundamental role of the layered-silicates in a styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer (SBS) as a function of layered-silicate dispersion during deformation was investigated. Predominantly immiscible composites of mixed morphology provided the initial proof that dramatic alteration of the SBS deformation behavior exists, but a clear understanding of the nature of reinforcement was precluded due to the fiber symmetric orientation of the SBS and the mixed clay morphologies. Following the theory of Vaia and Giannelis, use of a more hydrophobic organically modified clay resulted in an intercalated morphology with a near single crystalline texture of the SBS due to roll-casting. Significant heterogeneous deformation was observed at ambient conditions as well as at elevated temperature as verified through Cohen's affine deformation model in combination with Kratky's scattering pattern model. The intercalated morphology shows little or modest mechanical property enhancements at all temperatures studied. Exfoliated nanocomposite was produced by functionalization of the clay surfaces with polystyrene, altering the enthalpic interactions. Entropic interactions were also controlled by varying the molecular weight of the surfactant and the grafting density and shows remarkable agreement with the theory proposed by Balazs et al. Due to the increase surface volume ratio of the clay, a flipping transition of the block copolymer morphology was observed during roll-casting producing a near single crystalline parallel/parallel clay/BCP orientation. The modulus was relatively unaffected whereas the toughness increased significantly due to an earlier onset of strain hardening.",

By changing the stiffness of the substrate, human mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) could be directed along neuronal, muscle, or bone lineages. Matrix elastic modulus can also control anchorage dependent cell's motility, localization, tissue formation and organization. Besides that, synthetic materials such as biodegradable polymers offer a versatile alternative to naturally derived biopolymers. Their mechanical properties can be highly tailored and they are easy to synthesize and shape. Moreover, these platforms can be readily \"biologically\" fine-tuned toward a particular cell linage by incorporating well-documented parameters, which play crucial roles in cell-extra cellular matrix (ECM) signaling pathway, such as growth factor, surface topology and stimulation signal. Hence, these materials are suitable candidates to develop engineered matrices for stem cell culture, cell manipulating platforms in biological research and drug development. In this thesis, commercialization aspects of these engineered matrices for stem cell research, cell culture and drug development markets are evaluated both in USA and in Singapore markets. Technological barriers, intellectual property and a preliminary cost model are analyzed. A business plan is presented and discussed for applications in both the stem cell research and the drug screening markets. Although these two markets are ill-defined, both of them are growing rapidly and appear to be very promising. A review of the technology itself led to the conclusion that the matrix is capable of induce anchorage dependent cell into specific lineage but the success rate is not yet quantified and further research need to be done to achieve good reproducibility and to meet the required efficacy of the industry.",

Improved access and use of information are essential to better identify and anticipate threats, protect\r\n                  against and respond to threats, and enhance national and homeland security (NHS), as well as other national\r\n                  priority areas, such as Economic Prosperity and a Vibrant Civil Society (ECS) and Advances in Science and\r\n                  Engineering (ASE). This project focuses on the creation and contributions of a Laboratory for Information\r\n                  Globalization and Harmonization Technologies (LIGHT) with two interrelated goals: \r\n\r\n                  (1) Theory and Technologies: To research, design, develop, test, and implement theory and technologies for\r\n                  improving the reliability, quality, and responsiveness of automated mechanisms for reasoning and resolving semantic\r\n                  differences that hinder the rapid and effective integration (int) of systems and data (dmc) across multiple\r\n                  autonomous sources, and the use of that information by public and private agencies involved in national and\r\n                  homeland security and the other national priority areas involving complex and interdependent social systems (soc). \r\n\r\n                  This work builds on our research on the COntext INterchange (COIN) project, which focused on the integration\r\n                  of diverse distributed heterogeneous information sources using ontologies, databases, context mediation algorithms,\r\n                  and wrapper technologies to overcome information representational conflicts. The COIN approach makes it\r\n                  substantially easier and more transparent for individual receivers (e.g., applications, users) to access and exploit\r\n                  distributed sources. Receivers specify their desired context to reduce ambiguities in the interpretation of information\r\n                  coming from heterogeneous sources. This approach significantly reduces the overhead involved in the integration of\r\n                  multiple sources, improves data quality, increases the speed of integration, and simplifies maintenance in an\r\n                  environment of changing source and receiver context - which will lead to an effective and novel distributed\r\n                  information grid infrastructure.

Addressing problems of national priorities in such rapidly changing\r\n                  complex environments requires extraction of observations from disparate sources, using different interpretations, at\r\n                  different points in times, for different purposes, with different biases, and for a wide range of different uses and\r\n                  users. This research will focus on integrating information both over individual domains and across multiple domains.\r\n                  Another innovation is the concept and implementation of Collaborative Domain Spaces (CDS), within which\r\n                  applications in a common domain can share, analyze, modify, and develop information. Applications also can span\r\n                  multiple domains via Linked CDSs. The PIs have considerable experience with these research areas and the\r\n                  organization and management of such large scale international and diverse research projects. \r\n\r\n                  The PIs come from three different Schools at MIT: Management, Engineering, and Humanities, Arts & Social\r\n                  Sciences.

        "Abstrak": "As we approach the end of traditional CMOS scaling, further improvements in integrated circuit performance and functionality will become limited by the inherently low carrier mobility and indirect bandgap of silicon. These performance shortcomings can be supplemented with high performance semiconductors such as Ge and GaAs, which have respectively improved carrier mobilities and a direct bandgap for efficient light emission. However, due to the economic superiority of Si-based microelectronics, it is unlikely that the CMOS industry will abandon Si entirely. Instead, it will be necessary to integrate materials such as Ge and GaAs with the Si platform by means of engineered substrates. In this thesis, thin Ge layers were transferred to Si by wafer bonding of compositionally graded structures. This approach combines the beneficial aspects of graded buffers with those of wafer bonding to provide a coplanar integration platform for lattice-mismatched semiconductors. The various innovations that were necessary to realize epitaxial layer transfer from virtual substrates stem from the fact that thin films of Ge are difficult to planarize. The large surface roughness of graded buffers requires smoothing of the surface prior to bonding. The poor surface passivation of GeO2 in aqueous chemo-mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries necessitates that Ge virtual substrates be planarized indirectly, using a deposited CMP layer. Furthermore, H-induced exfoliation is the only practical method of separating a thin Ge layer from the surface of a virtual substrate, leading to extensive surface damage of the transferred layer.(cont.) This damage is traditionally removed using a CMP step for exfoliated Si layers. However for Ge transfer, a Sio.4Geo.6 etch-stop layer was incorporated for damage removal using a selective chemical etch. These techniques have enabled transferal of epitaxial Ge-on-insulator (GOI) structures to large diameter Si wafers. Tensilely strained layers have the ability to attract interstitially-dissolved hydrogen and accelerate the nucleation of platelets- both of which contribute to the layer exfoliation process. As a result, a strained Sio.4Geo.6 layer was used to enhance the exfoliation kinetics of Ge by providing a gettering site for ion-implanted hydrogen. During 250 C annealing of hydrogen-implanted Si0.4Ge.6/Ge gettering structures, preferentially-nucleated platelets are made to grow within the Sio.4Ge.6 layer with minimal loss of hydrogen to surface effusion. Subsequent annealing at a temperature exceeding >300 C yields significantly improved surface blistering kinetics over samples which do not contain a gettering layer. A platelet growth model was formulated accounting for both chemical and strain energy contributions to the free energy of platelet formation. Microstructure and strain relaxation data corroborate the free energy computations, revealing two kinetically- limited regimes of platelet growth within tensilely strained Sio.4Geo.6 layers. Low temperature annealing allows the platelets to grow in the strain-limited regime, resulting in a local platelet density of >1010 cm-2 and significantly improved exfoliation kinetics. Incorporation of strained layers has the potential of reducing the implantation dose necessary for layer transfer. Combined with virtual substrate bonding, gettering structures provide a promising solution for economical integration of high performance materials with silicon.",

        "Abstrak": "In this work, we examine fundamental materials processes in the growth of indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In particular, we realize improvements in the epitaxial integration of high-quality InGaP device materials on non-standard platforms, such as GeSi graded buffers orSi substrates, and InGaP or indium aluminum gallium phosphide (InAlGaP) graded buffers on GaP substrates. We apply these improvements to the design and implementation of strained-InGaP quantum-well light emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum. The innovative use of these traditional materials is intended to provide a solution for bright green solid-state light emitters. Initial modes of InGaP lattice-matched epitaxy on GeSi were studied. Three- dimensional growth was observed over a wide range of deposition temperatures and V/III ratios. Pre-growth thermal cycling in a H2 plus PH3 ambient led to a large increase in surface roughness and the formation of surface mesas. Thermodynamic simulations suggest that these mesas may be P clusters or GeP solid complexes. They may also be surface oxides formed in conjunction with water vapor in the deposition chamber. Such surface degradation prior to the initiation of epitaxy is unfavorable for monolayer growth. The development and evolution of defect microstructures in relaxed, compositionally graded InGaP buffers deposited on GaP were examined. In particular, the properties of branch defects in InGaP graded buffers were examined for a large number of growth and annealing conditions.(cont.) These studies confirm that branch defect formation is driven by surface, not bulk, processes. Branch defects in the bulk arise from surface features that are metastably \"frozen\" in place by subsequent deposition and propagate through the thickness of the sample. We conclude that branch defects comprise a local compositional fluctuation resulting from the clustering of In atoms. This identification is supported by the suppression of branch defect formation under conditions of reduced adatom mobility, including low growth temperature and high V/III ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that dislocations gliding in the [110] direction are -preferentially blocked by strain fields arising from nearly-[110]-oriented branch defects. This is further evidence for the link between branch defects and In clustering. A relaxed InAlGaP graded buffer platform was utilized in the design and fabrication of a novel strained-InGaP quantum-well epitaxial-transparent-substrate LED (ETS-LED). The best devices exhibited yellow-green emission with a primary wavelength of 590 nm and a secondary wavelength of 560 nm. These devices had [rho]TD = 7 x 106 cm2 and an In 0.32 Ga 0.68 P quantum well active region, and operated at 0.18 [mu]W per facet at 20 mA, corresponding to a luminous efficacy of approximately 0.01 1m/W. Transmission electron diffraction indicates that the observed spectral lineshape is the result of emission from ordered and disordered domains in the quantum well.

A digital video system was used to image the motion of particles far from the electrodes and their deposition onto the working electrode during application of a DC potential. The role of electrode reversibility was investigated and the performance of the as-deposited electrodes was improved by electrolytic plating of platinum. Particles were also seen to adhere to the substrate before reaching the electrode. Force distance curves were recorded using a colloid probe atomic force microscopy technique to directly measure the interaction of the silica particles with the sapphire substrate. This data validated the observed adhesion at the electrode and provided further support for the temporal and spatial reduction in pH. The role of Faradaic processes and the diffusion of potential determining ions in electrophoretic deposition was also considered. The zeta potential of planar sapphire substrates for three different crystallographic orientations was measured by a streaming potential technique in the presence of KCl and (CH3)4NCl electrolytes. The streaming potential was measured for large single crystalline C-plane (0001), A-plane (1120), and R-plane (1102) wafers over a full pH range at three or more ionic strengths ranging from 1 to 100 mM. The results reveal a shift in the iso-electric point (i.e.p.) of the three samples by as much as two pH units, with the R-plane surface exhibiting the most acidic behavior and the C-plane samples having the highest i.e.p.(cont.) The acidity of the sapphire wafers is explained in terms of an absence of adsorbed hydroxyl groups for these surfaces prepared at room temperature. Modified Auger parameters (MAP) were calculated from XPS spectra of a mono-layer of iridium metal deposited on the sapphire by electron beam deposition. A shift in MAP consistent with the observed differences in i.e.p. of the surfaces confirms the effect of surface structure on the transfer of charge between the Ir and sapphire, hence accounting for the changes in acidity as a function of crystallographic orientation.",

        "Abstrak": "Because of the limitations to the functionality that Si can provide, integration of light emitting materials such as GaAs and other III-V materials provides the promise for the combination of electrical and optical devices onto a Si platform. Monolithic integration, compare to hybrid integration, is the more cost effective and reliable way to combine these dissimilar materials. However, materials compatibility issues such as lattice mismatch, polar-on-non-polar epitaxy, and thermal mismatch make the direct growth of high quality GaAs-based material on Si difficult. However, with the use of SiGe virtual substrates, Si substrates that have the Ge lattice constant, this goal can be achieved since Ge and GaAs have a small lattice mismatch of only 0.07%. High quality GaAs on Si having a threading dislocation density lower than 3x 106 cm'2 on offcut SiGe virtual substrates has been demonstrated. While utilizing SiGe virtual substrate technology to enable high quality GaAs on Si, we have studied the crack formation in GaAs layers on SiGe resulting from the thermal mismatch between the film and the substrate. GaAs has a thermal expansion coefficient of 5.8x10-6 /Ê»C while the value for Si and the SiGe substrate is 2.6x10-6 /C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the SiGe virtual substrate is mainly dictated by the underlying Si substrate. As a result of the thermal mismatch, crack arrays can form in GaAs layers grown over a critical thickness after a temperature change. These cracks can act as electrical shorting paths and can also limit the usable area for device fabrication, and therefore need to be eliminated.(cont.) We have reported the experimental and calculated critical cracking thickness of GaAs on Si and SiGe in this work and have discussed possible strategies in the control of crack formation. We have also studied the luminescent characteristics of Ino.2Gao.8As quantum wells grown on the SiGe virtual substrates and other substrates such as GaAs, Si, and Ge. The luminescent intensities of InGaAs quantum wells on SiGe approach that of ones grown on GaAs substrates and out performs structures on Si and Ge substrates, an unexpected advantage for InGaAs quantum well integration on SiGe. In this work, we have also reported the first working optical interconnect on Si using SiGe virtual substrate technology. This relatively simple device structure proves the feasibility of monolithically integrated optical circuit architectures on the Si microelectronic platform. The performance of various optical interconnect structures is analyzed, and an alternative waveguide structure is proposed.",

Most Type I diabetics take insulin injections after each meal in order to remain euglycemic. Transplantations of islet cells in immuno-protective alginate capsules has been shown to be promising as a long-term cure for Type I Diabetes. In this study, reinforced alginate fibers were fabricated as an alternative to alginate capsules for islet transplantation. Surgical thread was covered in alginate-cell solution by the microfluidic nozzle system to give a stronger structure to be used for implanting the cells. The thickness of the cell-encapsulated alginate layer produced by microfluidic nozzle processing system was controlled by varying the flow rate of alginate being pumped through the nozzle as well as by varying the speed by which the thread was extracted from the nozzle. The study showed that higher flow rates of alginate and lower thread speeds result in thicker alginate layers for encapsulating more cells within the fiber. The cells remained viable over a month, suggesting plausibility of cell-encapsulated microfibers as a long term solution to diabetes treatment.",

Adaptation implies responsiveness to phenomena that are disruptive to a system's functioning; it is a willful evolution in response to changed circumstances. Adaptation occurs in cities when an event or fluctuation provokes a re-figuring towards new conditions or hazards. Considering current environmental and systemic changes in coastal post-industrial cities, this thesis explores adaptation and adaptability's form and function therein. Building on a history of adaptive design and natural hazards research, expectant design uses concepts of specificity, incrementality, participation, and phasing in design for urban adaptability. Expectant design employs flexible architectural and urbanistic strategies in response to climate change hazards and harbor redevelopment. Helsinki's new Kalasatama district is used as a testing ground for the development of adaptive design in coastal cities that are undergoing accelerating environmental change and demands for capacity. The design components of the adaptation armature illustrate a scheme that is incremental, flexible, expectant and public. Design arrives at an adaptation strategy that is implemented in a phased and open process, and that addresses the necessary adaptability involved in climate change adaptation strategies.",

        "Abstrak": "The magnetic field-induced strain (ferromagnetic shape memory effect - FSME) in Ni-Mn-Ga was first reported in 1996 by Ullakko et al. Since then, up to 6% FSME in single-crystal tetragonal-Ni-Mn-Ga samples has been observed in static fields, and up to 3% at 500 Hz. The present work demonstrates 6% FSME of a Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal of 5 x 5 x 9.85 mm³ in 200[mu]s is by application of a magnetic field pulse. It proves the feasibility of actuators operating at frequencies above of 1 kHz at room temperature for this geometry, and that the actuation can be accomplished using compact, air-core Helmholtz coils operated in pulsed mode. The eddy-current attenuation of 620 [mu]s-long pulses in the samples tested is small, reducing the need for lamination. The field-induced extension does not begin at the same time as the field. Part of the delay is the time that the field takes to reach the threshold level for actuation. The mass-inertia of the sample results in an additional delay, which depends on the position and number of mobile twin-boundaries in the crystal. The delay is maximum for a single twin-boundary moving from the fixed to the free end of the crystal. For several twin-boundaries distributed uniformly throughout the crystal the delay is shorter. The peak acceleration observed is 50 ± 10 m/s². For typical twin-boundary energies of the order of 40 erg/cm² homogeneous nucleation of partial dislocations was found to be unlikely. Accordingly, twin-boundaries must be seeded through stress. High-speed video images and photographs have demonstrated that field-induced twin-boundary motion is not uniform along a Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal. Twin boundaries stop when they reach certain positions of the crystal, and remain pinned unless the field is increased. The observed scatter in the data of field-induced extension is related to the existence of pinning sites. The maximum rate of extension can be expressed as an exponential function of the driving force, andreaches 6 m/s for saturated driving force in the present case.",

First, the successful application of electroless metal deposition within the sub-surface lamellar domains of an amphiphilic block copolymer is presented. Several electroless metals were selectively deposited inside the interconnected network of the water-permeable block domains containing pre-loaded palladium, which served as the spatially localized deposition catalyst. The technique proved to be a facile means to rapidly deposit large amounts of metals within the hydrophilic block domains, despite limitations on the transport of plating reagents into the bulk templates. The simple process yielded novel nanocomposites consisting of alternating layers of metal with those of the hydrocarbon matrix. The extent of metal deposition within the bulk block copolymer templates was controlled by adjusting the deposition rate and deposition time. Second, unique self-assembled thin film templates comprising in-plane arrays of nanosized surface cavities were investigated. The micellar thin films, formed by direct casting of kinetically stable styrene(PS)-acrylic acid(PAA) block copolymer reverse micelles from toluene onto solid substrates, consisted of lateral hexagonal arrays of spherical PAA domains in PS matrices. It was shown that hydration and swelling of PAA upon treatment in a monovalent base (NaOH) aqueous solution led to a cavitation process that exposed the PAA cores to the free surface.(cont.) The use of these cavitated PAA domains as open nanoreactors for the synthesis of corresponding nanocluster arrays following aqueous sequestration of metal ions into carboxyl-containing domains was demonstrated. Metal loading of the PAA domains could alternatively be achieved in the absence of cavitation by omitting the base treatment step, where the loaded PAA domains remained embedded within the original PS matrix. Additional stability was imparted to the nanoclusters synthesized within these closed nanoreactors relative to their cavitated counterparts. The option to employ either the open or the closed micellar templates represents a useful versatility of this system.",

        "Abstrak": "The (U-Th)/He thermochronmeter is the foremost tool available to geoscientists for the purposes of constraining the thermal evolution of the crust below 250°C. However, the potential of the technique is far from fully explored. The existing de facto (U-Th)/He age standard, the fluorapatite of Cerro de Mercado (Durango, Mexico), does not yield reproducible dates, an observation confirmed at several laboratories. A series of experiments combining analytical and numerical techniques suggests that variations in U and Th measured in a single sectioned crystal could result in several percent apparent age variation due to unequal alpha recoil exchange across internal zone boundaries. Heterogeneities may also play a role in the variability observed in the diffusive behavior of He in strongly zoned minerals, such as monazite. He diffusion experiments on monazite indicate that the closure temperature for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry is between 206°C and 286°C, but varies from grain to grain, even within suites of crystals obtained from one rock. This may be due to compositional variations in the host monazite. Typically heterogeneous monazite crystals may have different closure temperatures, and single crystals may preserve large portions of the cooling history of a rock.(cont.) None the less, monazite appears to have great potential for (U-Th)/He chronometry, and because of the high U and Th (and therefore 4He) concentrations observed in many monazites, it is a prime candidate for microanalytical (U-Th)/He. A microanalytical protocol for (U-Th)/He chronometry has been developed by applying the laser microprobe to polished crystals or crystal fragments of monazite. Agreement with conventional (U-Th)/He ages is to within -1.3%, with previously unavailable spatial resolution of -30pm. Large numbers of laser microprobe (U-Th)/He ages can be generated more rapidly than by conventional means, and this technique allows the dating of grains that would not be acceptable for conventional (U-Th)/He. Application of laser microprobe (U-Th)/He to monazites from Nanga Parbat, Pakistan, yields highly reproducible cooling ages within and between single crystals. Mean ages of 0.746 ± 0.049 Ma and 0.753 ± 0.036 Ma from two crystals, and the direct observation of negligible (U-Th)/He age gradients, support minimum mean cooling rates of > 325 K/m.y., and minimum mean rock uplift rates of > 4 km/m.y.. Laser microprobe (U-Th)/He of zircon produces no geologically useful dates, a consequence of the poor U and Th measurements provided by LA-ICPMS.(cont.) Future efforts should employ better calibrated LA-ICPMS approaches or next-generation electron microprobe techniques, which can provide more accurate U and Th concentrations than LA-ICPMS, even for the low concentrations found in zircon.",

Hardware was designed and constructed to measure frequency bandwidth, magnetic-field-induced strain, stress and magnetization driven from an applied magnetic field. The bandwidth in this investigation was only limited by inductive reactance of the hardware, not by fundamental limitations of Ni-Mn-Ga. Degradation of the peak dynamic actuation strain occurred from 3.0% to 2.6% with increasing number of cycles from Nz1,000 to N 100,000. Measurement of strain, stress, and magnetization driven by a magnetic field permitted the comparison of measured properties versus properly defined thermodynamic properties. The peak thermodynamic piezomagnetic coefficient is d3, 1,= 2.5 x 10-7m / A compared to the experimental slope, dE/dH, of 1.0 x 10-7 m / A at N-1,000 cycles and 1.4 x 10-7 m / A at N-100,000 cycles, respectively. The thermodynamic piezomagnetic coefficient is five times greater than Terfenol-D with d31 = 5.0 x 10-m / A. The magnetic susceptibility varies between 3-10, while the twinning stiffness varies between 30-40 MPa within the average bias stress range of 0.3 to 2.8 MPa. At optimum fields and bias stresses, the mechanical energy density during cyclic deformation was 65 kJ/m3 at the expense of 20 kJ/m3 lost An important first observation of dynamic stress vs. field behavior is understood by an extension of a magnetomechanical phenomenological model.(cont.) The mechanism of stress generation is thought to be magnetization rotation causing negative magnetostriction with quadratic magnetic-field dependence before twin boundaries move. Above the threshold field for twin boundary motion, stress increases in proportion to the magnetic-field-induced strain. Dynamic actuation measurements performed here help put Ni-Mn-Ga FSMAs into perspective with other active materials performance: Ni-Mn-Ga FSMAs are between low bandwidth, high strain, Nitinol and high bandwidth, low strain Terfenol-D and ferroelectrics.",

        "Abstrak": "Renewable energy is one of the most important technologies for decarbonizing the economy and fighting climate change. In recent years, wind energy has become cheaper and more widely adopted. However, the variable nature of wind production creates unique challenges that are not faced by conventional thermal technologies. Several studies to date have showed the decrease in economic value of wind energy as penetration increases due to this variable nature. Plus, they also show that high wind penetration favors intermediate energy sources such as natural gas. I claim however, that few of these studies have considered the dynamic behavior and feedbacks of these systems, including investment delays and learning curves. This thesis uses system dynamics models to simulate the long term changes in the electric grid for Texas. The goal is to test two hypothesis: that the economic value of wind energy decreases as penetration increases, and that variable wind production favors natural gas technologies. It does this by calculating how wind energy changes the shape of the net load duration curve for a given region. This affect changes the profitability of different technologies in unique ways, due to their different fix and variable costs. The conclusions of this thesis are consistent with the literature, with the caveat that they are highly dependent on assumptions regarding the learning curve for energy technologies. The economic value of wind decreases, but this effect can be compensated by lower costs, leading to a continuing adaptation. Faster Wind adoption also reduces the profitably of technologies with high fixed costs such as coal and nuclear, and favors intermediate and peaking sources such as natural gas.",

Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) imaging potentially enables the physically-encrypted verification of nuclear weapons in a manner that would meet treaty requirements. This thesis examines the physics behind NRF, develops tools for processing resonance data, establishes methodologies for simulating information gain during warhead verification, and tests potential inference processes. The influence of several inference parameters are characterized, and success is shown in predicting the properties of an encrypting foil and the thickness of a warhead in a one-dimensional verification scenario.",

        "Abstrak": "Moth eyes minimize reflection over a broad band of angles and colors and lotus leaves minimize wetting over a broad range of breakthrough pressures by virtue of subwavelength structures patterned on their respective surfaces; similar examples of organisms exploiting geometry to attain properties unavailable in bulk materials are abundant in nature. These instances have inspired applications to man-made structures, collectively known as functional materials: for example, self-cleaning/anti-fogging surfaces, and solar cells with increased efficiency. I fabricated a functional surface where both wetting and reflectivity are controlled by geometry. Using a periodic array of subwavelength-sized high aspect ratio cones, patterned on glass and coated with optimized surfactants, I have experimentally shown that we can significantly enhance transmission from the surfaces of a glass slab, and at the same time make the surfaces either superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic, depending on the applications, such as antifogging and self-cleaning glass. Novel lithographic techniques result in high patterning accuracy over large surface areas, and is easily adaptable to nanoimprinting for future mass replication. In addition, an all-dielectric subwavelength-patterned Luneburg lens was fabricated for operation at free-space wavelength of A =1.55 um.",

        "Abstrak": "Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing can be used to fabricate high resolution (~100 nm) features at high rates (~10 kHz), and is compatible with a wide range of materials. However, conventional EHD printing techniques focus only on homogeneously dispersed functional inks, including nanoparticulate materials, molecular and polymers. This thesis explores EHD printing of liquids containing microparticles. For printing, liquids containing microparticles with a diameter of ~1-10 pm are prepared, which sediment upon loading into the capillary tip. A single-tip EHD apparatus enabling pulsed delivery of kilovolt signals, high speed imaging, and measurement of charge transfer to the substrate has been constructed. Using this apparatus, it is shown that pulsed voltage signals can cause printing of liquid droplets, streams, and aggregates containing microparticles, at rates of ~10 kHz. Upon evaporation of the liquid, the particles organize into clusters that, depending on the deposition conditions, may form continuous lines or regularly spaced aggregates. By first-order modeling of the forces exerted on the particles, it is concluded that the amount of colloidal material ejected from the capillary is influenced by the packing of the particles within the meniscus, their size, the strength of electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions, and other factors. Future work should focus on the design of the colloidal solution and EHD parameters to enable controlled and consistent ejection of particles, and improvement of the accuracy of deposition. This process therefore is attractive for additive manufacturing of composite materials by direct deposition of microparticles.",

Since 1992 observational surveys have discovered over one thousand of these objects, believed to be fossil remnants of events that occurred nearly 4.5 billion years ago. Sixteen of these objects are currently known to be binaries, and many more are expected to be discovered. As part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) I have helped catalog nearly one third of the known Kuiper Belt object (KBO) population, and used that database for further physical studies. Recovery observations for dynamical studies of newly discovered objects with the Magellan telescopes and a high resolution imager, MagiC, revealed three binaries, 88611 (2001QT297), 2003QY90, and 2005EO304. One binary was found in the discovery observations, 2003UN284. Lightcurve measurements of these, and other non-binary KBOs, were obtained to look for unique rotational characteristics. Eleven of thirty-three objects, excluding the binaries, were found to have measurable variability. One of these objects, 2002GW32 has a particularly large amplitude (> 1 magnitude) of variability, and 2002GP32 has a relatively short (3.3 hours, single-peaked) lightcurve.(cont.) Among the binary population all the observed objects showed some level of variation. The secondary of 88611 was fit with a single-peaked period of 5.50*0.02 hours while the primary component appears to be non-variable above the measurement errors (0.05 magnitudes). Neither component appears to be color variable. The components of 2003QY90 are both highly variable yielding single-peaked rotation periods of 3.4±1.1 and 7.1±2.9 hours with amplitudes of 0.34±0.12 and 0.900.36 magnitudes, respectively. The rotation periods are comparable to those of other non-binary KBOs although distinct from that of an identified contact binary. Orbits and partial orbits for Kuiper belt binaries (KBBs) show a wide range of eccentricities, and an increasing number of binaries with decreasing binary semi-major axis. These characteristics exclude the formation models proposed by Funato et al. (2003) and Weidenschilling (2002), respectively. Conversely, the formation models of Astakhov et al. (2005) and Goldreich et al. (2002) appear to describe the observations, at least in part.",

        "Abstrak": "State estimation, or data assimilation as it is often called, is a key component of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Nearly all implementable methods of state estimation suitable for NWP are forced to assume that errors remain in regimes of linear error growth and retain distributions of Gaussian uncertainty, yet nonlinear systems like the atmosphere can readily allow regimes of nonlinear error growth and, in turn, produce distributions of non- Gaussian uncertainty. State-of-the-art, ensemble-based methods of state estimation suitable for NWP are examined to gauge the consequences and relevance of violating the linear error growth assumption. For quite generic sources of non-Gaussian uncertainty, the methods are observed to fail, as they must, and the obtained analyses become probabilistically unreliable before becoming inaccurate. The mispositioning of coherent features is identified as a specific, geophysically relevant source of non-Gaussian uncertainty that can easily cause the state-of-the-art methods of state estimation to fail. However, an understanding of relevant phenomenology sometimes allows these same methods to remain successful owing to an available redefinition of the involved errors. The redefinition is phrased as an alternative error model. It is recognized and exploited that non-Gaussian additive Eulerian errors can come from Gaussian Lagrangian position errors. A two-step, augmented state vector approach is developed that is suitable for use with coherent features and that relies only on implementable methods of state estimation.(cont.) By combining the dual Eulerian and Lagrangian state information into one vector, an ensemble can approximate their covariance, thus allowing each component's uncertainty to be reduced. The first step of the two-step approach reduces the feature position errors in an effort to render the residual additive errors Gaussian, thereby allowing the second step of an implementable state estimation method to proceed successfully. Philosophically, the two-step approach uses physical knowledge of the problem (as phrased by the error model) to compensate for neglected important non-Gaussian uncertainty structure in the state estimation process. The proposed two-step approach successfully allows use of implementable methods of state estimation to obtain probabilistically reliable analyses in regimes of nonlinear error growth, something unavailable using current standards.",

        "Abstrak": "The production of future generation integrated circuit devices requires precise control of impurities on the silicon surface. Cleaning of silicon wafers has historically involved the use of concentrated chemicals, large amounts of rinse water, and elevated temperatures to remove particles, metals, and organic matter from the surface. Poor understanding of the mechanisms of contamination has necessitated large margins of error in cleaning processes and has made cleaning the largest consumer of resources in an IC process line. Explosive growth within the semiconductor sector coupled with the increased need for cleaning in device manufacturing presents an enormous burden for the natural environment. By better understanding the relevant parameters in a cleaning step, future process will continue meet performance specifications while simultaneously reducing their impact on the environment. The environmental performance of the manufacturer is limited by the available technologies for wafer cleaning. Design changes occurring at the tool, chemical, and system level all affect the overall environmental impact of a fab . A modified Cost of Ownership (CoO) expression based on the tool consumable cost (CC), footprint (F), yield (Y), throughput (T), and utilization (U) is presented as a guideline for identifying the next generation of 'green' technologies. Barriers to the implementation of an ideal wetbench are also discussed. The intrinsic silicon-HF interface provides a baseline for understanding the impact of contamination on the electronic quality of the surface. Minority carrier lifetime measurements made by Radio-Frequency Photoconductance Decay (RF-PCD) show that defects on this surface are not described by any known models for a single mid-gap, electronic state. A model is presented in which each physical defect introduces two coupled mid-gap states. By analogy with Pb-centers observed at the Si-Si02 interface, these states correspond to the three physical states of a dangling bond. The doublyoccupied state may play a role in native oxide growth and metal deposition; the unoccupied state is a likely site for attack during fluoride etching. Metal contaminants at the silicon-liquid interface have also been studied using RF-PCD. The deposition of part per trillion (ppt) levels of Cu is shown to increase by a factor of 17 .5 by using a 500: 1 solution of HF instead of a 100: 1 solution. This strong dependence arises from a shift in the electrochemical potential at the wafer surf ace. With the reduction in [Ir], the potential shifts to more cathodic values and causes the Cu deposition rate to increase. To prevent unacceptable levels of contamination from dilute HF solutions, the purity of a D:l HF bath must scale as D-1.78.",

This work explores selective growth conditions in the SiH2Cl2/SiH4/GeH4/H2 system between 650-850⁰C, without the addition of C12 or HC1, on substrates patterned by both conventional and interferometric lithography. We have achieved several important milestones for the fabrication of vertical MOSFETs by selective growth in 100 nm SiO2 features patterned by interferometric lithography. We have observed excellent selectivity to SiO2 masks with SiH2C12 at 750⁰C, perfect epitaxial Si filling of SiO2 features, the facet morphology during growth, and the effects of n-type doping on selective growth. We have also fabricated extremely sharp p-n diode doping profiles. With the above accomplishments we have demonstrated the feasibility of vertical MOSFET fabrication through selective epitaxial growth. To realize the advantages of advanced MOSFET designs on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, we have developed a facet-free raised source/drain process utilizing moderate n-type doping of Si selective growth and <110>-oriented vertical SiO2 sidewalls. However, to improve SiO2 spacer dimension fidelity and eliminate Si substrate overetching, a novel SiO2/Si3N4 spacer process was developed. The keys to the SiO2/Si3N4 spacer process are removal of the Si3N4 layer prior to growth and increased Si ELO growth by moderate in situ n-type doping. This process has wide ranging application to both SOI and bulk Si technologies for fabrication of low-resistance contacts in advanced devices.(cont.) By a combination of interferometric lithography Si/SiO2 substrate patterning and Ge selective epitaxial growth, we have demonstrated threading dislocation blocking at the oxide sidewall which shows promise for dislocation filtering and the fabrication of low defect density Ge on Si for III-V device integration. Defects at the Ge film surface only arise at the merging of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) fronts from neighboring holes. These results confirm that epitaxial necking can be used to reduce threading dislocation density in any lattice-mismatched systems where dislocations are not parallel to growth directions. Investigation of Ge selective growth in micron-sized SiO2 features by plan-view TEM shows that substrate patterning on the order of microns is insufficient to filter dislocations in a large mismatch system ([epsilon] > 2%). Ge p-i-n photodetectors were selectively grown in micron-sized SiO2/Si features to correlate materials properties with electrical characteristics. For chemical protection and compatibility with Si microelectronics, Ge photodetector regions were capped with a thin n+ Si layer. Photodetectors fabricated on unpatterned substrates demonstrated leakage currents comparable to published results on Ge on Si photodetectors while leakage currents were noticeably degraded in devices grown on patterned substrates.",

The evolution of such synergies encoded in the spinal cord could be dictated by mechanical stability requirements for interacting with the environment or by particular performance advantages. Previous work in frogs and cats has shown that the isometric forces measured during movements evoked by intraspinal stimulation converge to a stable equilibrium. In non-isometric conditions, however, there is no guarantee that a similar property of convergence will be observed. We therefore characterized the stability properties of trajectories produced by spinalized frogs. Hindlimb movements in frogs were measured and phasic force perturbations were applied by a Phantom robot (Sensable Tech., Inc) attached at the ankle. EMGs were recorded from 12 hindlimb muscles and used to trigger the perturbations in both hindlimb-to-hindlimb wipes and withdrawals. In both behaviors, we found that the final position of the movements was stable in that the ankle trajectory after perturbation moved to the final position of the unperturbed trajectory. Following deafferentation, wiping movements showed a similar, although weaker, recovery after perturbation. Thus the stability properties found during isometric conditions also hold in dynamic conditions. These results show that spinal neural systems are able to stabilize goal-directed movements.",

They function as a connection between the cell body to the focal adhesions in order to transmit forces into and out of the cell. During the force transduction process, many proteins bind to actin filaments in order to initiate a signaling cascade that reaches the cell nucleus. However, the effects of forces in the binding kinetics between actin filaments and actin binding proteins are unknown. This work proposes an experimental setup to study the force-dependent binding kinetics of such proteins at the single molecule level by using an instrument that combines optical trapping with single molecule fluorescence. The main focus of this work was the design and construction of the experimental equipment. The results show position detection capabilities with a resolution of 5 nm. Also, the trap stiffness recorded was in the order of 0.05 pN/nm. With the combination of position and trap stiffness, the force resolution of the instrument is about 0.25 pN. Also, a photobleaching event for a single dye molecule was recorded, proving the single molecule fluorescence capabilities. In addition, a complete experimental assay is described in order to perform studies on how force application affects the binding of actin and actin binding proteins.",

The applicability and limits of a fracture mechanics based life prediction is explored. Comparisons are made against highly controlled experiments and less controlled but more realistic experiments using a novel dovetail attachment fixture. Surface engineering approaches are examined from a mechanics perspective. Using a new tool, depth sensing indentation, the mechanical properties of an aluminum bronze coating are determined. Fretting fatigue experiments are performed on specimens coated with aluminum bronze and on specimens treated with low plasticity burnishing. Low plasticity burnishing is a new method of introducing beneficial compressive residual stresses without significant cold work at the surface. A mechanics based approach to the selection of palliatives is addressed.",

        "Abstrak": "A detailed model was developed for an ionic electro-active polymer (EAP) actuator. The electrical and chemical domains of the system were modeled using a simple electrical circuit. Ionic charge storage within the polymer was described using a linear reticulated model. This model improves upon the continuum diffusive model introduced in prior work by providing a low order model of diffusion that can be analyzed in the context of modern and classical control methods. Additionally, the reticulated diffusion model describes the dynamics of ionic charge distribution within the polymer, which enables a more precise calculation of electromechanical coupling. An interesting observation of ionic electro-active polymers is that they exhibit enormous asymmetry in coupling from electrical to mechanical domains. While electrical potentials produce large linear displacements (5% strain or greater), uniaxially-applied mechanical loads result in a negligible electrical back effect. This is surprising, suggesting that there are huge entropic losses when applying mechanical loads. After examining the mechanics of the system it was theorized that the apparent lack of coupling is actually the result of the Poisson Effect, which causes changes in the volume of an object when uniaxial loads are applied. A derivation of the stored electrical energy and strain energy led directly to a set of constitutive equations that are able to account for the asymmetric coupling observed in EAP. The solution to the uniaxial loading boundary condition was developed fully and compared to prior work. Experimental results from an EAP actuator composed of polypyrrole, a widely-used conducting polymer, validate the electro-mechanical coupling model. MATLAB was used to simulate the(cont.) response of the actuator and the results compared to the experimental data. Results verify that the model accurately describes the electrical, mechanical, and coupled behavior of the system. The correlation between the model and experimental data is very good for electrically-induced strains up to 3% and applied potentials up to 1 Volt above the potential of zero charge (PZC); these are within the typical operating range of polypyrrole. The model is sufficiently simple to allow real-time control while also exceeding prior models in its ability to predict polymer behavior in normal operating ranges.",

Various control policies are implemented in simulations of manufacturing systems to test whether they increase the efficiencies of the systems in terms of specific performance measures of interest. Among the control policies, Control Point Policy (CPP) is deeply studied, because this policy is designed for controlling complex manufacturing system with multiple product types. First, fundamental research in CPP is presented to understand the effects of the parameters on single product type manufacturing systems. Then, multiple product type, assembly-disassembly systems are studied with various control policies, including hybrid policies. Finally, a real automobile manufacturing system case study is presented, and various control policies are experimented on in the simulation model. Because the evaluations of performances are done by simulations, the speed of simulation becomes a very important problem. This thesis therefore presents a new approach to accelerating the speed of simulation.",

        "Abstrak": "CRISPR-Cas systems are a diverse family of RNA-protein complexes in bacteria that target foreign DNA sequences for cleavage. Derivatives of these complexes have been engineered to cleave specific target sequences depending on the sequence of a CRISPR-derived guide RNA (gRNA) and the source of the Cas9 protein. Important considerations for the design of gRNAs are to maximize aimed activity at the desired target site while minimizing off-target cleavage. Because of the rapid advances in the understanding of existing CRISPR-Cas9-derived RNA-guided nucleases and the development of novel RNA-guided nuclease systems, it is critical to have computational tools that can accommodate a wide range of different parameters for the design of target-specific RNA-guided nuclease systems. We have developed CRISPRseek, a highly flexible, open source software package to identify gRNAs that target a given input sequence while minimizing off-target cleavage at other sites within any selected genome. CRISPRseek will identify potential gRNAs that target a sequence of interest for CRISPR-Cas9 systems from different bacterial species and generate a cleavage score for potential off-target sequences utilizing published or user-supplied weight matrices with position-specific mismatch penalty scores. Identified gRNAs may be further filtered to only include those that occur in paired orientations for increased specificity and/or those that overlap restriction enzyme sites. For applications where gRNAs are desired to discriminate between two related sequences, CRISPRseek can rank gRNAs based on the difference between predicted cleavage scores in each input sequence. CRISPRseek is implemented as a Bioconductor package within the R statistical programming environment, allowing it to be incorporated into computational pipelines to automate the design of gRNAs for target sequences identified in a wide variety of genome-wide analyses.

Within this thesis, using a combination of multi-sited ethnography, textual analysis, historical documentation analysis and memoir writing, I attempt to provide various macro and micro perspectives on what it means to be a gay man located in Gay Bombay at a particular point of time. Specifically, I explore what being gay means to the members of Gay Bombay and how they negotiate locality and globalization, their sense of identity as well as a feeling of community within its online/offline world. On a broader level, I critically examine the formulation and reconfiguration of contemporary Indian gayness in the light of its emergent cultural, media and political alliances. I realize that Gay Bombay is a community that is imagined and fluid; identity here is both fixed and negotiated, and to be gay in Gay Bombay signifies being 'glocal' - it is not just gayness but Indianized gayness. I further realize that within the various struggles in and around Gay Bombay, what is being negotiated is the very stability of the idea of Indianness. I conclude with a modus vivendi - my draft manifesto for the larger queer movement that I believe Gay Bombay is an integral part of, and a sincere hope that as the struggle for queer rights enters its exciting new phase, groups like Gay Bombay might be able to cooperate with other queer groups in the country, and march on the path to progress, together.",

With suitable coating, these nanoparticles are biocompatible, stable in solution, and absorbed by tumor cells in good contrast. The mechanism of heating is mainly due to Neel relaxation process and a quantity called specific loss power (SLP) / specific absorption rate (SAR) is used to describe the heating effect. Past clinical studies have shown minimum side effects and proven the success of the new thermotherapy as a treatment modality in conjunction with chemo- or radiotherapy. Studies are in progress to improve the nanoparticles' heating power to enable treatment of small tumors and metastases, thermoablation as a monotherapy, and to achieve tumor-specific thermotherapy with the aid of tumor-finding molecules. This paper evaluates the novel technology that is magnetic nanoparticles-based thermotherapy and explores its commercialization potential. It explains the medical need driving the innovation, examines the technology in comparison with existing cancer therapies, identifies the strategic position the technology has in the present state of market for cancer therapies, and explores opportunities and Challenges in the introduction of the new therapy into the U.S. market.",

Components in professional service firms are the expertise areas in which the firms have developed proficiency or those in which they plan to develop it. Competitive advantage in professional service firms is related to the capacity of the firm to add continuing value to a dynamic set of clients and to itself. In order to add value, professional service firms, being knowledge intensive, must develop capabilities that enhance the knowledge capital they possess, which is valuable to both its clients and to the professionals they employ. This knowledge capital can be classified into Human Knowledge, Relational Knowledge and Structural Knowledge. The first two types are comprised mainly of tacit knowledge, while the third one consists of explicit knowledge. Architectural innovation modes result from the reconfiguration of these knowledge types in ways that enhance the value creation processes of professional service firms.

Our approach focuses on using desktop experiments to perform a precise exploration of the parameters affecting buckling. We examine two separate modes of axial rotation: continuous rotation and oscillatory rotation. In each case, we demonstrate potential for significant increases in helical buckling length by a factor of as much as 5 within the parameter space studied and develop an understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play. In the case of continuous rotation, we compare our experimental results to theoretical predictions motivated by this work.

It presents architectural opportunity at the physical scale of the mega-city and the time scale of the geological, advocating for a manipulation of our environment that extends architectural operation beyond our life-span, human labor, and predefined architectural program. From nature's perspective, mass material movements are one of the ways in which it deconstructs; in the case of a natural disturbance, one can observe the rebirth of material from one form to another. Geological timelines witness the entire re-composition of materials. Materiality has always been at the heart of many architectural issues, from assembly to phenomenological and economics discussion, informing the way we construct. In architecture, aggregation of material is a wide-ranging topic, but can most traditionally be thought of as stone or concrete. This thesis takes on the issues of aggregate materials at the edge of a balanced state. As this non-equilibrium state begins to suggest the very pressing concern of environmental hazards, the project speculates on a scenario that is more frequently encountered by urban populations and is increasingly well documented as instrumentation becomes more widespread and risks increase. Perhaps we can find a way to construct an architecture that changes material phasing as a response to natural geological processes. Abstracting conditions to a lab-like studio setting, the project explores the subject of aggregation and accumulation.",

The first two utilized an array of infra red light bulbs to heat up the array, and did store enough energy to cook with. However in the third test the battery was heated using a hot plate, and after the storage period still retained enough heat to boil 20 cups of water.

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis, the use of highly mobile sonar platforms is investigated for the purpose of acoustically classifying compact objects on or below the seabed. The extension of existing strategies, including synthetic aperture sonar and conventional imaging, are explored within the context of the buried object problem. In particular, the need to employ low frequencies for seabed penetration is shown to have a significant impact both due to the relative length of the characteristic scattering mechanisms and due to the interface effects on the target scattering. New sonar strategies are also shown that exploit incoherent wide apertures that are created by multiple sonar platforms. For example, target shape can be inverted by mapping the scattered field from the target with a team of receiver vehicles. A single sonar-adaptive sonar platform is shown to have the ability to perform hunting and classification tasks more efficiently than its pre-programmed counterpart. While the monostatic sonar platform is often dominated by the source component, the bistatic or passive receiver platform behavior is controlled by the target response. The sonar-adaptive platform trajectory, however, can result in the platform finishing its classification effort out of position to complete further tasks.(cont.) Within the context of a larger mission, the use of predetermined adaptive behaviors is shown to provide improved detection and classification performance while minimizing the risk to the overall mission. Finally, it is shown that multiple sonar-adaptive platforms can be used to create new sonar strategies for hunting and classifying objects by shape and content. The ability to sample the scattered field from the target across a wide variety of positions allows an analysis of the aspect-dependent behavior of the target. The aspect-dependence of the specular returns indicate the shape of the target, while the secondary returns from an elastic target are also strongly aspect-dependent. These features are exploited for improved classification performance in the buried object hunting mission.",

        "Abstrak": "The rotator cuff is composed of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subcapularis, and teres minor tendons. Rotator cuff injuries are common athletic and occupational injuries that surgery cannot fully repair. Therefore tendon tissue engineering can provide alternatives to surgical solutions. Tendons are composed of parallel lines of bundles of collagen fibers and fibroblasts called fascicles and a glycoprotein, superficial zone protein (SZP), which is expressed by the gene, proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) may play a role in joint and intrafascicular lubrication. Studies have shown that a smooth muscle actin isoform (SMA), which plays a role in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, is expressed in the rotator cuff tendon cells. Previous investigations have been conducted to study PRG4 expression and distribution in different regions of the infraspinatus (ISP) tendon. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavior of adult goat ISP tendon cells and bovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) cultured in three-dimensional pellets in chondrogenic (CM), expansion (EM), and tenogenic media(TM).(cont.) The focus was on the effects of such growth factors as TGF-[beta]1 and hormones such as dexamethasone and various culture methods, such as the use of 96-well plates and 15 ml tubes, on the ISP tendon cells' and BMSCs' cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, and expression of PRG4 and SMA. ISP tendon cells and BMSCs were obtained from five adult Spanish goats ranging. After 14 days, the pellet cultures were analyzed using Safranin-O staining and immunohistochemical staining for SZP and SMA. The biochemical contents of the cell pellet cultures were also evaluated using a DNA assay on days 0 and 14 and a GAG assay on day 14. It was found that CM, containing TGF-[beta]1 and dexamethasone, induced the most cell proliferation and chondrogenesis. SZP was expressed in all of the ISP tendon cells pellet cultures that were cultured in tubes. In comparison to the larger CM-pellets, the ISP tendon and BMSC EM- and TM- pellets cultured in tubes had higher percentages of SMA present. However SMA was also expressed in the CM-pellets cultured in the 96-well plates.(cont.) The results of our study showed that environmental differences can change SMA expression. Further investigations on tendon cells and the effects of growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and culture methods on the cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, and SZP and SMA expression need to be conducted.",

        "Abstrak": "Defects in articular cartilage exhibit little spontaneous healing response, in part due to the limited number of chondrocytes available to infiltrate the defect and the absence of a provisional fibrin scaffold to accommodate cell migration into the lesion. One variable related to tissue engineering strategies employing cell-seeded scaffolds to treat such defects is the amount of cartilage formed in the construct prior to implantation. The objectives of this thesis were to evaluate effects of scaffold cross-link density and bioreactor culture environment on chondrogenesis in cell-seeded type II collagen scaffolds in vitro, and to begin to test effects of implant compositional maturity (viz. glycosaminoglycan, GAG, content) on chondral defect repair. Scaffold cross-link density, a determinant of cell-mediated scaffold contraction and degradation, affected chondrogenesis; scaffolds of low cross-link density that experienced contraction exhibited greater cartilaginous tissue formation compared to highly cross-linked scaffolds that resisted contraction. In addition to tissue-level effects on histogenesis, cross-link density was found to direct phenotypic differentiation at the cellular level. When employing marrow-derived stem cells as an alternative to chondrocytes, scaffolds with lower cross-link densities (and thus less resistance to contraction and degradation) favored chondrocytic differentiation.(cont.) In comparison to these findings, bioreactor culture of chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds demonstrated little benefit over static culture with respect to histogenesis within the first 2 weeks of culture. To begin to investigate effects of implant maturity on in vivo repair outcome, chondrocyte-seeded type II collagen scaffolds achieving 30% of the GAG content in native cartilage were implanted in chondral defects in a caprine model. Repair tissue evaluated at 15 weeks consisted primarily of fibrocartilage and small amounts of hyaline tissue. Implantation of the construct reduced fibrous tissue formation compared to controls, but did not significantly affect other outcome variables. Future animal investigations will evaluate effects of implanting constructs with GAG contents 50% and 75% of that in normal cartilage. An additional study evaluated a construct comprised of a non-cell-seeded type II collagen scaffold and a bone graft substitute for treating osteochondral defects in a goat model. These implants qualitatively improved bone formation, but did not significantly improve repair of cartilage compared to controls.",

        "Abstrak": "In recent years, cold-atom experiments have moved towards atomic systems with increasingly stronger interactions. One goal is to emulate condensed-matter phenomena in an ultimately controlled system by studying the motion of atoms in optical lattices. Trapped ions are the epitome of a strongly-interacting cold-atom system, but until now have been limited to simulating spin systems. In this thesis work, a toolbox is developed for combining trapped ions with optical lattices and for studying problems of atomic crystals in periodic potentials. One such problem of tremendous technological and economic importance is friction - a ubiquitous phenomenon that is poorly understood even at the atomic level (nanofriction), where stick-slip processes are known to be the dominant source of dissipation and wear. Friction is studied in this thesis work with unprecedented spatial resolution and control at the individual-atom level in the synthetic frictional interface between crystals of trapped ions (moving object) and an optical lattice (rigid corrugated substrate). These experiments address, at the atomic scale, four quintessential questions about friction: the dependence of friction on the load (corrugation depth), on material properties (object-substrate lattice mismatch), on the contact area (number of atoms at an atomically smooth contact) and on velocity and temperature. In particular, we observe the elusive regime of superlubricity - the vanishing of stick-slip friction - for ion crystals mismatched to the lattice. With increasing load, we observe superlubricity to break and stick-slip friction to reappear as a result of a long-theorized sliding-topinned structural transition known as the Aubry transition. Although these effects were initially predicted to occur in the infinite-atom limit, we find them to arise already at the level of two or three atoms in our system. The presented results could potentially lead to ways of engineering friction in nanomaterials or even at the macroscopic scale, and the system can further be used to study quantum many-body physics of solids in periodic potentials, potentially relevant to friction and surface physics at the nanoscale and at cold surfaces.",

        "Abstrak": "Consider the problem of migrating a company's CRM or ERP database from one application to another, or integrating two such databases as a result of a merger. This problem requires matching two large relational schemas with hundreds and sometimes thousands of fields. Further, the correct match is likely complex: rather than a simple one-to-one alignment, some fields in the source database may map to multiple fields in the target database, and others may have no equivalent fields in the target database. Despite major advances in schema matching, fully automated solutions to large relational schema matching problems are still elusive. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of automated large relational schema matching. Our key insight is the observation that modern database applications have a rich user interface that typically exhibits more consistency across applications than the underlying schemas. We associate UI widgets in the application with the underlying database fields on which they operate and demonstrate that this association delivers new information useful for matching large and complex relational schemas. Additionally, we show how to formalize the schema matching problem as a quadratic program, and solve it efficiently using standard optimization and machine learning techniques. We evaluate our approach on real-world CRM applications with hundreds of fields and show that it improves the accuracy by a factor of 2-4x.",

        "Abstrak": "Previous experimental research into ancient pottery production has proven that potters can produce vessels with varying materials properties, such as thermal shock resistance and permeability. These properties are differentially useful for certain tasks, such as cooking or water-cooling. In certain cases, such as the use of shell temper in North America, an improvement in thermal shock resistance seems to provide an explanation for why the new temper was adopted along with the introduction of a new food type -- maize. It remains an unanswered question, however, whether potters in a large variety of situations were choosing to alter their production techniques or materials to produce pots intended for different functions that exhibit different materials properties. I investigated this question by applying techniques and concepts from materials science, anthropology, and archaeology. This combination of materials science and social science was pioneered by Heather Lechtman and Dorothy Hosler, and is called the \"materials approach.\" My research focuses specifically on pottery production in the Middle Balsas Region of Guerrero, Mexico, from approximately 300 BC to AD 1300. I investigated whether potters in the Middle Balsas were using different production techniques or raw materials for vessels that were intended for specific functions. I chose the Middle Balsas Region as the geographical focus for my research because little systematic archaeological investigation has focused on that area, especially in the Late Preclassic and Classic periods (300 BC-AD 900). In order to gather appropriate data, I mapped, surface collected, and excavated at three Middle Balsas sites. I then categorized the pottery and analyzed a selected portion via thin section analysis/petrography.(cont.) The combination of field work and laboratory analyses that I used provided me with data on the production techniques practiced by Middle Balsas potters and allowed me to identify what wares and vessel shapes were characteristic of various time periods. I determined that Middle Balsas potters produced a consistent set of wares and vessel shapes made from a variety of clay sources, and that the clays I identified in their vessels always contained a consistent volume fraction of non-plastic inclusions. The majority of the clays used in these vessels naturally contain the high levels of non-plastic inclusions identified. When the clays did not contain this volume fraction of inclusions, the potters added a sand temper to the clays to reach their \"ideal\" volume fraction. The consistency that I identified in the production of Middle Balsas pottery lasted over one thousand years, which is unusual in Mesoamerica. I suggest that this production pattern may have occurred because a small number of potters who used a specific, shared technique made the vessels for the entire community.",

        "Abstrak": "The need for structural based acoustic control is evident in aircraft, aerospace, and naval systems. A promising approach utilizes active materials to intelligently control the dynamic response of light-weight, modally dense structures suppressing the radiated acoustic power. The basic representative structural element of a single panel offers an analytically tractable basis for examining various control methodologies for mitigating the acoustic response. An electro-mechanical Rayleigh-Ritz structural model is combined with an expression of the acoustic power radiated from a rectangular panel to yield a fully coupled structural-acoustic model. The insight afforded by this model is used to design the sensor and actuator architecture of the active structure for optimal closed-loop acoustic performance. The manufacturing of a composite panel with eight embedded active fiber composite (AFC) actuators and collocated strain sensors is presented in detail. The geometry of the test article is designed to represent the dynamics of the target applications, and the active elements are embedded in the composite panel to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology. Active control methods are explored through simulations and experiments to compare the applicability to active structural-acoustic control (ASAC). To quantify the comparison, designs based on classical low-authority feedback, optimal feedback, and x-filtered LMS feedforward techniques are presented. The results lend insight into the inherent limitations and advantages of each approach to the problem of broadband control. The investigation is application motivated in that the sensing and piezoelectric actuation occur solely at the structure while the performance is measured in the acoustic field. The conclusions consider the analytically predicted performance along with the corresponding experimental achievement to develop an understanding of the key issues necessary to apply the technology to the active structural-acoustic control of complex systems.",

A brief overview of the World Wide Web is given-how and why it came to be, where it is now, and a glimpse at where it's headed. Public participation is reviewed-reasons for it, some of the challenges faced in its practice, and a widely regarded, though seldom implemented model for achieving success with it, based on methods set forth by Christopher Alexander. Ways that Web 2.0 tools can be applied to overcome the common challenges, and ways they can be used to facilitate the model for success are identified. To show how such results can be attained in practice, a hypothetical scenario is constructed, in which a fictional planning team uses the full capabilities of Web 2.0 to facilitate public participation while authoring an area plan. The closing chapter identifies a short list of potential barriers to using the Web in public participation, and offers some ideas for dealing with each. The research draws from literature written on public participation in urban design and planning, and literature written about the World Wide Web. Interviews of experts from both areas were conducted. Existing and emerging Web 2.0 tools were analyzed, and a test of concept was constructed to prove it's easy to solicit public feedback using Web 2.0.

        "Abstrak": "In the area of direct metal part manufacture, the 3DPTM process has several inherent advantages over traditional machining and P/M technologies: hard tooling is not required to manufacture parts, geometries may be created which can not be made by conventional processes, and the composition of parts may be controlled locally on a 100 gm scale. The surface finish of 3DPTM parts will be a key factor in the determination of what parts are candidates for direct manufacture via the 3DPTM process. Powder size is the limiting factor in the determination of the surface finish of 3DPTM parts. On the micro scale, it determines the roughness due to particle arrangement, and on the macro scale it determines the thinnest layers from which parts may by built. The 3DPTM process has been adapted to a fine metal powder (ten micron particle diameter) material system. Powder spreading, ink-jet technology, and the effect of print parameters on printing with fine metal powders have been examined. Powder spreading experiments were conducted to examine the limits of layer thickness and packing density. 420 ss, S-7 tool steel, and 316L ss powderbed beds were generated in fifty micron layers. Packing densities of 55%, 59% and 59% respectively were obtained for the three powders. Line printing experiments were conducted with both continuous jet (CJ) and drop on demand (DOD) printheads to examine the relationship between droplet frequency, droplet spacing and the quality of printed lines. Lines were printed at droplet frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 40 kHz and with droplet spacings from ten to fifty microns. Low print frequencies and small droplet spacings result in the highest quality lines. A droplet spacing of thirty microns and a droplet frequency of 667 Hz was chosen for the printing of 3-D parts with a Hewlett- Packard DOD printhead. 3-D part geometries were generated using fifty micron layers of ten micron 420 ss powder. These parts demonstrated the improvement in surface finish achieved with fine metal powders and the capability to create parts from fields identified as promising for the direct fabrication of metal parts via the 3DPTM process.",

The purpose of the models is to gauge the importance of oil vaporization as a contributor to overall engine oil consumption. Another purpose of the models is to study the effect of various engine designs and operating conditions on oil vaporization. The models are based on a mass convection analysis. Various sub-models for the establishing the state and properties of the engine oil as well as the convecting gas are presented. The model was implemented numerically and results were generated by simulating the behavior of a heavy-duty diesel engine. Running at 2200 RPM and full load while using an SAE 15W40 oil, oil vaporization from the liner is seen to be about 1.3 grams per hour per cylinder, or about 10% of the total oil consumption for this engine. At the same conditions, oil consumption due to vaporization from the ringpack is found to be about 3.6 grams per hour per cylinder, or about 30% of the total oil consumption for this engine. Therefore, vaporization from in-cylinder sources appears to be a significant contributor to overall engine oil consumption. For both models, the results are highly dependent upon the local temperatures and the local oil composition. Also, the high rates of vaporization seen from the ringpack may contradict the fundamental assumptions upon which the ringpack vaporization model was built. A study of liquid oil transport in the ringpack is required to fix this potential problem.",

Given a CG image, we retrieve a small number of real images with similar global structure. We identify corresponding regions between the CG and real images using a novel mean-shift cosegmentation algorithm. The user can then automatically transfer color, tone, and texture from matching regions to the CG image. Our system only uses image processing operations and does not require a 3D model of the scene, making it fast and easy to integrate into digital content creation workflows.

        "Abstrak": "The U.S. Green Building Council, the Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council are currently developing a rating system aimed at evaluating the environmental sustainability of new neighborhood developments. The system, known as LEEDND (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Developments), will be the first comprehensive set of planning and design standards that has the potential for widespread adoption by the development industry. In the absence of a set of standards like these, planners and developers have traditionally looked to older communities that exhibit well-regarded environmental design as models. Because LEED-ND has the potential to supplant these example as a model for guiding future environmental planning and design endeavors, the extent to which LEED-ND captures the values manifested in earlier models should be evaluated. This thesis applies the LEED-ND standards retroactively to three existing communities that the planning and development professions have held up as good examples of environmentally sensitive design. Rather than using the new rating system to evaluate the developments, the developments themselves are used to evaluate LEED-ND and the degree to which it reflects the goals of traditional ecological planning. While the case studies each score high enough to be considered \"LEED Certified\" (on a modified version of the LEED-ND standards), they all follow a pattern of poor performance on several credits related to smart growth and New Urbanist design ideals. These points indicate areas in which the environmental values of the planning profession have changed over time, and how these values may manifest themselves in the physical design of the built environment.(cont.) The final analysis addresses the challenges of developing systems for evaluating and ranking development projects and how LEED-ND could be adapted to encourage environmentally sustainable design across the spectrum of urban to rural neighborhood development.",

        "Abstrak": "This study starts from the notion that leadership is about mobilizing learning, and simultaneously pursues multifaceted purposes that benefit from each other: 1) to shed new light on learning behaviors of teams facing unfamiliarity, 2) develop one model of practical and effective leadership education, and 3) apply new technology to make methodological contributions to organizational studies, leadership education, and management practices. 1) The central research question is what behavioral factors affect team learning when the team faces both internal and external unfamiliarity - which stems from diversity and cultural barriers, and disruptive threats from the environment. The study examines 6 multicultural teams undergoing increasingly complex tasks, revealing the structures and processes with which they self-organized and temporal responses to the difficulties. 2) The experimental setting was a 10-days intensive leadership workshop with a distinct educational purpose to raise the participants' levels of contextual, reflective, and moral awareness, with the premise that exercising leadership involves mobilizing learning to adapt to unfamiliarity. The study attempts to assess the effectiveness of the workshop, while examining the effects of exercise of leadership on the teams' learning processes. 3) The study also applies wearable sensors that capture nonlinguistic social signals and visualize group interaction patterns, for 3 intended applications as (a) research tool for social network analysis to supplement ethnography, (b) learning tool to stimulate reflection and dialogue, and (c) intervention tool to alter the flows of information.(cont.) The study identified 3 team learning strategies: inoculation (face internal difficulties earlier and get prepared for an external threat), time out (stop actions when facing a threat and use it to re-orient team's attention to internal difficulties), and structure it away (develop an internal structure that eliminates the internal difficulties). The conditions for team learning and personal development, appropriate challenge and support, resulted from exercise of leadership that emerged from complex interactions among the team members and the facilitators. Commonly observed signs of such conditions included surfacing and facing conflicts, revealing vulnerabilities, accommodating emotional breakdowns, and sense of mutual respect based on demonstrated acceptance. The study indicates that use of sensors contributed to formation of the team learning condition.",

        "Abstrak": "There is significant interest from both the academic and industrial communities for understanding and controlling the self-assembly behavior of complex macromolecular systems and has been an active area of research in recent years. Such systems can be designed to result in a wide range of nanoscale morphologies and greater functionality can be introduced with increasing complexity.This thesis focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a class of side chain liquid crystalline block copolymers (SCLCBCPs) that are based on a low glass transition temperature (Tg) siloxane backbone. Moieties that self-assemble into smectic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are covalently attached to the polystyrene-polyvinylmethylsiloxane (PS-PVMS) block copolymer backbone. Precise control over the functionalization of the LCs onto the functional siloxane backbone allows for unique control over the self-assembly and the resulting properties of the system. The LC content significantly affects the stability of the smectic mesophase and subsequently the interactions with the inter-material dividing surface (IMDS) with the PS domains. A strong preference for homogenous anchoring of the LC moieties relative to the IMDS is observed, and increasing the LC content intensifies the preference for this arrangement. Utilizing the effects of LC anchoring to alter the self-assembly behavior is a reoccurring theme throughout this work. Additionally, the mechanical properties of these materials can be precisely manipulated over several orders of magnitude through variations in LC content and the block copolymer backbone architecture.Several methods can be used to manipulate the morphologies of these materials once synthesized including, thermal annealing and mechanical deformation.(cont.) Thermal annealing provides additional mobility for self-assembly often resulting in morphological rearrangements. Mechanical deformation can be used to orient the self-assembled structures relative to an applied shear flow. Additionally, the self-assembled morphologies of spin cast into thin films were investigated. The presence of the substrate has significant effects upon the orientation of the morphologies; thermal annealing and variations liquid crystal content are shown to be useful tools for achieving a wide range of thin film morphologies.",

Despite the common criteria of characterization, many factors contribute to MSC heterogeneity (i.e., tissue origin, coexistence of cell subsets at different stage of differentiation, epigenetic) and no standard methods have been approved to characterize MSCs in cell culture.\r\nAim: The present study aimed to test whether MSCs resist adverse chemical and physical culture conditions, surviving MSC subpopulations are endowed with the stemness abilities; to characterize MMP expression in AAA-MSCs under the adverse experimental conditions.\r\nMethods and Results: MSCs enzymatically isolated from human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA-MSCs) were exposed to media acidification, hypoxia, starving, drying and hypothermia through the following strategies: (1) low-density seeding in closed flasks; (2) exposure to a chemical hypoxia inducer, cobalt chloride; (3) exposure to a dry environment with growing medium deprivation and culture at 4°C. None of these conditions affected MSC viability and stemness profile, as evidenced by NANOG, OCT-4, and SOX-2 mRNA expression in surviving cells. A significant MMP-9 decrease, especially when AAA-MSCs were exposed to hypothermia, was associated with stress resistant stem cells.\r\nConclusions: AAA-MSCs survive to extremely adverse culture conditions, keeping their morphology and stemness features. Besides MMP-9 role in pathological tissue remodeling, this protease may be related to MSC survival. Future studies on MSCs derived from other tissues will be necessary to refine our culture protocol, which can represent an empirical method to demonstrate MSC stemness, with potential implications for their clinical use.\r\nIntroduction",

        "Abstrak": "Metal price volatility is undesirable for firms that use metals as raw materials, because price volatility can translate into volatility of material costs. Volatile material costs and can erode the profitability of the firm, and limit material selection decisions. The undesirability of volatility gives firms an incentive to try to gather advanced information on fluctuations in price, and to manage-or at least control their exposure to-price volatility. It was hypothesized that since price can be a measure of the scarcity of a metal, that other metrics of scarcity risk might correlate with price. A system dynamics simulation of the aluminum supply chain was run to determine how well some commonly used metrics of scarcity correlated with future changes in price, and to explore some conditions that strengthened or weakened those correlations. Additionally, prior work has suggested that increased recycling rates can lower price volatility. The study of the correlation of scarcity risk metrics with price is accompanied by a study on how the technical substitutability of secondary metal for primary, termed secondary substitutability, affects the price volatility. The results show that some scarcity risk metrics modeled (alumina price, primary marginal cost, recycling efficiency, and the static depletion index) weakly correlate with future primary metal price, and hence volatility. Other metrics examined (recycling rate, mining industry Herfindahl Index, the acceleration of the mining rate, and the alumina producer's marginal cost) did not correlate with the future primary price. Correlations were stronger when the demand elasticity was high, the secondary substitutability was high, or the delays in adding primary capacity were low. Regarding managing price volatility, greater secondary substitutability lowers price volatility; likely because it increases the elasticity of substitution of secondary for primary metal-this result is explored mathematically. The model results show that some scarcity risk metrics do weakly correlate with future primary price, but the strength of the correlation depends on certain market conditions. Moreover, firms may have some ability to manage price volatility by increasing the limit for how much secondary metal they can use in their product.",

        "Abstrak": "Many effectors of microtubule assembly in vitro enhance the polymerization of subunits. However, several S. cerevisiae genes that affect cellular microtubule dependent processes appear to act at other steps in assembly, and to affect polymerization only indirectly. Here we use a mutant [beta]-tubulin to probe cellular regulation of microtubule assembly. tub1-724 mutant cells arrest at low temperature with no assembled microtubules. The results reported here demonstrate that the heterodimer formed between Tubl-724p and P-tubulin is less stable than wild type heterodimer. The unstable heterodimer explains several conditional phenotypes conferred by the mutation. We also describe genes that affect formation of the tubulin heterodimer. Our approach to identify such genes is based on the observation that excess Rbl2p, a ,- tubulin binding protein, is lethal in tub1-724 mutant strains. We show that excess Rbi2p is similarly lethal to cells bearing mutations in CIN1 and PAC2. Genetic and biochemical analysis demonstrates roles for each in heterodimer formation in vivo. Both haploid and heterozygous tub1-724 cells are inviable when, PAC2, is over-expressed. These effects are explained by the ability of Pac2p to bind [beta]-tubulin, a complex we demonstrate directly. And, excess Cin1p rescues the phenotypes of tub1-724 cells, strongly supporting a catalytic role for Cinlp in heterodimer formation. Pac2p is associated with Cinlp and with the tubulin polypeptides. The activities of these proteins in vivo are both similar to and distinct from the role of their homologues in vitro assays for tubulin folding. Our results uncover potential roles for these proteins in catalyzing tubulin heterodimerization in vivo and so in maintaining the balance between individual tubulin polypeptides. Both excess [beta]-tubulin and benomyl lead to loss of microtubules, large budded cell-cycle arrest and cell death. This parallel is supported by the consequences that changes in the level of either Rbl2p or [beta]-tubulin have for both of these microtubule poisons. Overexpression of either gene rescues cells from the effects of 3-tubulin overexpression and confers increased resistance to benomyl. We screened for galactose-induced cDNAs that confer resistance to benomyl in wild type cells. We describe the identification and initial characterization of two genes that allow cells to Live on Benomyl when Overexpressed (LBO).",

Several glass flattening techniques are presented in this thesis, including a method of thermally shaping individual sheets of glass using porous mandrels as air bearings developed at the Space Nanotechnology Lab. This method, a second generation slumping tool, eliminates the problems of sticking and dust particle-induced distortion that plague traditional slumping methods. A detailed mathematical model of the slumping process is developed, allowing prediction of final glass shape based on process parameters that include air supply pressure, imperfections on the mandrel surface, glass total thickness variations and gravity vector orientation. Simulations were conducted for a variety of scenarios to study the impact of apparatus tilt and pressure asymmetries on glass shape. Experiments to verify model findings are conducted under closed-loop control of pressure and apparatus tilt. Little improvement in repeatability is seen, suggesting that the error is due to unmodeled forces such as contact forces from the glass holding technique. Finally, the design process and fabrication of a third generation slumping tool is presented. In addition to scaling the design to accommodate larger flats, slumps are done horizontally to float the glass and minimize contact during the process. New capabilities of the tool also include active gap measurement and control, as well as plenum air temperature monitoring.",

        "Abstrak": "Many organisms, in response to selective pressures imposed by their environment, have evolved mechanisms that allow them to generate phenotypic variation. Such phenotypic variation can result from genetic regulation, in which changes in DNA sequence produce the variant phenotype, or epigenetic regulation, in which there are no changes in DNA sequence associated with the variant phenotype. This doctoral thesis describes the identification and analysis of novel phenotypic variation among populations of the bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This phenotypic variation, most easily identified as a switching between smooth and wrinkled colony morphologies, involves changes in several adhesive and morphological phenotypes. Experiments reveal that this phenotypic switch is the result of both genetic and epigenetic regulation. The genetic component of this phenotypic variation involves mutation at either of the two yeast Ras-GAP encoding genes, IRA] and IRA2. The IRA genes are hot spots for mutation, as loss-of-function mutations at these genes are much more frequent than mutations at other loci (- 10-6). Several factors regulate the genetic stability of these genes, including DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. Genetic analysis demonstrates that both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways of DSB repair maintain genetic stability at the IRA loci. Since these pathways specifically process a DSB substrate, this suggests that directed DSB formation may be the initiating event for IRA+ to ira- switching. ira- mutations activate transcription of the yeast cell wall glycoprotein genes, FLOO0 and FLO11, producing the variant adhesive and morphological phenotypes described above.(cont.) The epigenetic regulation of this phenotypic variation acts via the expression of FLOO and FLOl]. In addition to activation by ira' mutations, these FLO genes are regulated by epigenetic silencing, resulting in the variegated expression of both genes in a clonal population of cells. Silencing at FLOlO is regulated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins Hstlp and Hst2p, whereas silencing at the FLO]l gene requires the HDAC Hdalp. In addition, silencing of FLOO1 and FLOll is dependent on their positions in the genome, suggesting that their locations are relevant to their regulation and function. Epigenetic silencing also regulates differentiation. Upon nitrogen starvation, diploid S. cerevisiae strains will undergo a developmental transition from yeast to pseudohyphal forms, which is regulated by silencing at the FLO1] locus. In summary, our analysis of phenotypic variation in S. cerevisiae provides a new perspective into both the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for generating diversity in eukaryotic organisms.",

In this thesis, molecular simulation techniques are used to gain insight into the solvent effect on glycine crystallization in water-methanol mixtures. We report the validation of the Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force field and parameters with modified Lennard-Jones parameters for hydrogens attached to a-carbon in glycine zwitterion. Solution and interface simulations in water and 50% v/v water-methanol solutions reveal the mechanism through which methanol additive results in the crystallization of the least stable [Beta]-glycine polymorph. Free energy calculations through the Umbrella Sampling method show an increased stability of the centrosymmetric dimer structure ([alpha]-glycine growth unit) in the presence of the methanol additive. Even though the dimer structure is more stable in water-methanol mixtures, a higher fraction of glycine monomers were observed in water-methanol mixtures. It is revealed through thermodynamic arguments that a drastic decrease in solubility results in a higher fraction of glycine monomers in water-methanol mixtures. It was hypothesized in previous studies that the presence of monomer units docking onto the (010) interface of [alpha]-glycine inhibits further growth due to exposed ammonium groups at the interface. The effect of solvent on crystal growth inhibition is explored by the interface simulations of a-glycine in water-methanol mixtures. When the monomer units are docked onto the interface, water is shown to be more effective than methanol in inhibiting crystal growth of (010) interface of [alpha]-glycine. This study sheds light on the role played by the solvent on glycine polymorph selection in water-methanol solutions.",

Over the same time period a trend of humans moving into suburban communities further from the urban core developed. These people inadvertently enhanced their new suburban environment to be more appealing to certain generalist species known as nuisance wildlife. Policy decisions for nuisance wildlife species are made at a national or state level; however, municipalities manage most nuisance wildlife-human conflicts. An individual town or city is responsible for controlling populations of nuisance species both financially and tactically. Given that a municipality must select a wildlife management tactic when conflict occurs, do different decision-making processes yield different outcomes? This study identifies the link between public process and management outcomes; a connection that informs municipalities of the decision-making methods that lead to the most effective wildlife management.Through an examination of resident Canada goose management in four small Massachusetts cities and towns this study demonstrates the processes used to select nuisance wildlife management plans and the success or failure of those plans. Through the trials of the municipalities examined, it is clear that management plans selected in the most straightforward and transparent manner, and those that engage the public experienced the greatest success.

Hypothesizing: a technological innovation is primarily a match between a new business opportunity and an invention. The literature review redacts the recent developments regarding ways of sourcing inventions, new ways to build business opportunities, and best practices for assessing innovation projects.

The analysis is conducted by describing each organization, gained through interviews and research, with specific attention to the source of inventions, the way new business opportunities are generated, and the dynamic interactions between inventions and opportunities. The analysis of the Langer Lab and IDEO suggests a possible blueprint for inventive organizations, it reveals the high level of attention both organizations pay to business opportunities, and it shows the critical role of the interactions between opportunities and inventions during the early stages of the innovation process. Similarly, the study of the MIT ecosystem unveils numerous mechanisms fostering those interactions at every stage of the innovation process.

One effective way to accomplish this is through vehicle lightweighting, which can be achieved by material substitution, novel vehicle component design, and changes in processing. Although primary vehicle mass reduction is often associated with additional costs to the automaker, a decision to lightweight may, depending on when in the vehicle development process the decision is taken, result in additional secondary mass savings such that the value derived from lightweighting is greater than the costs. In this study, the concept of secondary mass savings, or mass decompounding, is developed using regression analysis. Moreover, the full, both primary and secondary, mass savings potential is assessed at different times in the vehicle development process. Lastly, powertrain and market trend modeling are employed to estimate the value of the compounded mass savings in terms of improved fuel economy and acceleration. This methodology is applied to a collected vehicle dataset in order to generate a model by which the value of and the subsystem-specific amount of secondary mass savings may be easily estimated during the early stages of vehicle development. In summary, this analysis may be employed to evaluate the economic competitiveness of vehicle lightweighting options at different times in the vehicle development process.",

Surface bound stimulusresponsive polymers are ideal candidates for above applications due to their conformational sensitivity to many stimuli with controlled molecular weight, composition, architecture and topology. In this thesis, one particular class of stimulus-responsive polymers, pH-sensitive comb-type graft copolymers with ionizable main chain segments was investigated. Mono(end)-functional thiol-terminated poly(methacrylic acid-gethylene glycol) (HS-poly(MAA-g-EG)) with three different macromolecular architectures (number average molecular weight, Mn = 27K, PEG graft density, PEG(%) = 7.7%, backbone contour length, Lcontour= 41.1 nm; Mn= 15K, PEG(%) = 8.8%, Lcontour = 22.1 nm; Mn = 17K, PEG(%)= 1.9%, Lcontour = 39.8 nm) have been synthesized via atomic transfer radical polymerization and characterized by 'H NMR, GPC and FT-IR. Stimulus responsive surfaces were prepared via chemically end-attached \"brush-brushes\" formed by chemisorption of the copolymers on Au substrates. Chemically specific high resolution force spectroscopy (HRFS) was carried out with probe tips (end radius-50 nm) functionalized with HS(CH2)10COOH (a carboxy-terminated selfassembling monolayer or COOH-SAM) to measure the normal nanoscale interaction forces, F, as a function of probe-tip sample separation distance, D,in a series of aqueous buffer solutions of varied pH (=4-9) and constant ionic strength (IS=0.005M NaC1).(cont.) The higher PEG grafting density surfaces (27K, 15K) exhibited the unique property of \"nanomechanical switching\" with pH, i.e. the normal intersurface force inverted from net repulsive (high pH, ionized uncomplexed side chains) to net attractive (low pH, sidechain/main-chain hydrogen bonding complexation). The 17K polymer brushes did not exhibit nanomechanical switching and maintained a slightly repulsive intersurface force at low pH. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to assess the adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) to these poly(MAA-g-EG) brushes in aqueous buffer solutions of varying pH. Polymers with a higher grafting density of hydrophilic PEG side chains and longer polymer backbones showed much less HSA adsorption at high pH and more protein adsorption at low pH. Surprisingly, HSA adsorption was found to be greatly amplified at intermediate pH6 (~1.4-1.8 x greater than that of the hydrophobic state of polymer layers at pH4). Higher PEG grafting density and a longer polymer backbone demonstrated larger protein adsorption amplification at pH6, which may be due to increased molecular mobility/disorder at a metastable state of the conformational transition. For the lateral force interaction between the end-grafted polymer layers and a probe tip (nominal radius - 50 nm) functionalized with OH-SAM (HS(CH2)11OH), as pH decreased, both the 27K and 17K polymer layers exhibit an abrupt change in lateral proportionality coefficient (ratio of lateral force to normal force) between pH7.1 and pH6 with larger lateral proportionality coefficients, [mu] ~ 0.63-0.89 at pH 4-6 and decreased [mu] ~ 0.12-0.34 at pH 7.1-9.(cont.) The 27K polymer had relatively higher p values at pH < 6 (0.89±0.19) but smaller [mu] at pH > 7.1 (0.21±0.04) than the 17K polymer, indicating that a more dramatic change in lateral force coefficient is expected for stimulus-responsive graft copolymers with higher side chain grafting densities.",

        "Abstrak": "Most materials produced by Nature and by human beings are heterogeneous. They contain domains of different states, structures, compositions, or material phases. How these different domains are distributed in space, or in other words, how they connect to one another, determines their macroscopic properties to a large degree, making the simple rule-of-mixtures ineffective in most cases. This thesis studies the macroscopic effective diffusion, diffusional creep, and elastic properties of heterogeneous grain boundary networks and composite solids, both theoretically and numerically, and explores the microstructure-property correlations focusing on the effects of microstructural connectivity (topology). We have found that the effects of connectivity can be effectively captured by a percolation threshold, a case-specific volume fraction at which the macroscopic effective property undergoes a critical transition, and a set of critical scaling exponents, which also reflect the universality class that the property belongs to. Using these percolation quantities together with the generalized effective medium theory, we are able to directly predict the effective diffusivity and effective diffusional creep viscosity of heterogeneous grain boundary networks to a fairly accurate degree. Diffusion in composite solids exhibits different percolation threshold and scaling behaviors due to interconnectivity at both edges and corners. Continuum elasticity suffers from this complexity as well, in addition to the complicating factor that each phase is always characterized by several independent elastic constants. These issues are each addressed in detail. In addition to studying all the above properties for a random distribution of grain boundaries or phases, we have also studied the effects of correlations in spatial distributions.(cont.) This topic is especially important in materials science, because virtually no materials exhibit random phase distributions. We have examined the percolation of effective properties for correlated microstructures spanning between the random distribution and the perfectly periodic distribution. An important result of this work is new understanding about what correlations may be considered small, or inconsequential, to the percolation scaling behavior, and which are large or long-range, and lead to a loss of universality. Finally, a rigorous, and easy-to-use, analytical homogenization method is developed for periodic composite materials.",

        "Abstrak": "The subject of this thesis lies at the interface of microfabrication technology and advanced biomaterials synthesis and processing for use in designing and fabricating novel tissue engineered constructs. The unifying theme is to use micron and sub-micron fabrication strategies to form advanced tissue engineering scaffolds which are able to precisely control the microenvironment of cells. These efforts are organized into two thrusts; (1) materials synthesis and process development for microfluidic scaffold fabrication and (2) micro- and nanofabricated synthetic substratum for controlling cell function. In the first thrust, materials-specific processes for the fabrication of poly(glycerol-co-sebacate), a synthetic elastomeric biodegradable polyester, into three-dimensional, hepatocyte-seeded microfluidic constructs is discussed. Material advantages of natural proteins motivated the fabrication of next-generation microfluidic scaffolds using silk fibroin from the Bombyx mori as a bulk material. The need to combine the advantages of both natural proteins and synthetic polyesters motivated the synthesis and characterization of a new class of biodegradable elastomers termed poly(1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane-co-polyol sebacate) (APS). APS polymers are tunable and possess the advantages of both natural and synthetic polymers. APS polymers induce a favorable biomaterial-tissue response including reduced fibrous capsule formation and macrophage recruitment compared to PLGA. In vivo degradation half lives could be controlled to between approximately 6 and 100 wks by adjusting polymer composition and processing. The second thrust focuses on the interaction with cells and synthetically fabricated nanotopographic substrates for potential in vascularized tissue engineering applications.(cont.) The contact guidance response of human embryonic stem cells to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates with 600 nm ridge-groove geometry and 600 ± 150 nm feature height was characterized. This motivated the study of endothelial progenitor cell function and morphology on nanofabricated PDMS substrates. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were found to exhibit increased doubling time from 16.2 ± 0.8 to 20.9 ± 1.9 h for cells grown on flat and nanotopographic substrates, respectively. EPCs cultured on nanotopographic substrates had a faster velocity and enhanced directed migration. The average velocity of EPCs on nanotopographic and flat substrates was 0.80 ± 0.45 and 0.54 ± 0.27 pm-min-1, respectively, while the effective displacement due to migration was 23.6 + 12.1 and 15.6 ± 10.1 Pm. Lastly, an in vitro capillary tube formation assay induced the formation of larger, more organized vascular structures in EPCs cultured on nanotopographic (411 ± 209 pm) versus flat substrates (140 + 35.6 [mu]m). This work has validated the potential impact of microfabricated scaffolds in tissue engineering by modulating cell function and controlling microenvironmental parameters.",

This virus template showed superior controls of material syntheses from nanoscale to microscale. Structures including nanowires, nanoparticle arrays, hetero-particle arrays, and micro-fibers were fabricated using the engineered MI3 virus as the building block and mineralization platform. The mineralization mechanisms were revealed by alternating the types and amounts of peptide motifs displayed on the viral templates. The results showed the importance of a fused peptide motif to mediate the mineralization process of a material, which was dominated by either physical absorption or chemical nucleation. The potential applications of the materials synthesized using the viral template, including energy generation and biosensors, were also demonstrated. For the first time, several types of highly engineered MI 3 virus were used to fabricate nanostructures such as nanowires, nano-arrays, hetero-particle arrays, and complex nanowires. A type 8 phage library was reported to screen peptide motifs for making nanowires. A multi-functionalized viral template, type 8-3 virus, was engineered and demonstrated to create a variety of nano-archietetures. A type 8+8 virus was used to create complex nanowires embedded with different materials. In addition, the mechanical properties of virus-based materials were evaluated and characterized for the first time. The tunable functionalities and mechanical performances of virus-based materials showed promising capabilities not only to manipulate material syntheses and structures but also to be integrated with other synthetic materials using current processing techniques.",

Components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the general transcription factor TFIID, and the SAGA chromatin modification complex were found to have roles in expression of distinct sets of genes. The results reveal an unanticipated level of regulation which is superimposed on that due to gene-specific transcription factors, a novel mechanism for co-ordinate regulation of specific sets of genes when cells encounter limiting nutrients, and evidence that the ultimate targets of signal transduction pathways can be identified within the initiation apparatus. Understanding how DNA-binding proteins control global gene expression and chromosomal maintenance requires knowledge of the chromosomal locations where these proteins function in vivo. We developed a microarray method that reveals the genome wide location of DNA-bound proteins and used this method to monitor binding of gene specific transcription activators in yeast. A combination of location and expression profiles was used to identify genes whose expression is directly controlled by Ga14 as cells respond to changes in carbon source, and by Thi2 in the absence or presence of thiarnin. The results identify pathways that are coordinately regulated by these regulators and reveal novel functions for these regulators. Understanding a transcriptional network such as these will be useful in constructing a cellular regulatory network map. The use of microarray technology has created new challenges in data analysis for biologists. Visual displays can greatly facilitate the analysis and communication of large quantities of data. We have created a Graphical Display Suite (GDS) that consists of a collection of tools to assist in the visualization of data from genome-wide experiments in S. cerevisiae. The ODS is web-accessible, easy to use, and additional components can easily be incorporated into its interface. This suite of tools has proven to be useful in revealing important biological insights.",

        "Abstrak": "An estimation of the energy yielded from the explosion created by the crash of United Flight 175 into the World Trade Center was conducted to rule out the possibility of other explosive elements (i.e. a bomb) on board. The amount of fuel ignited and the corresponding energy yielded by the fireball was estimated by studying videotapes of the crashes. The calculated volume of fuel vapor, which is consumed to form the fireball, is a fraction of the estimated total fuel aboard the plane upon impact. Due to thermal expansion, the fuel vapor quickly expands forming a high fuel/air mixture and ignites. The energy yield from combustion estimated from the videos using maximum rise height and burning time corresponds with a rough initial estimate of the energy yield using a fraction of the volume of fuel estimated on board the plane at impact. A conservative estimate of the energy released by TNT explosives is significantly less than the energy yielded by the jet fuel aboard the plane. Therefore, the presence of explosives on the plane is highly unlikely. In addition, although a bomb would not contribute significantly to the energy yielded, it is hypothesized that one could have been used to ensure that the fuel ignited after impact. This would also be unnecessary because the material properties of the fuel makes ignition almost certain. Recommendations for future studies are to develop methods of flying that have lower energy potential, to examine how a plane breaks apart during impact, and to prevent ignition of jet fuel when released.",

It may sputter ineffectively in its role as the engine of energy economics. For energy efficiency and conservation, it is increasingly necessary to invest in systems, tools and practices that can facilitate bi- or multi-directional flow of energy to control or balance consumption with the goal to reduce carbon footprint. The central dogma of an energy oligopoly and uni-directional distribution through the electricity grid is poised for a radical overhaul. An “internet” of electricity capable of executing differential distribution strategies from capacity generated by a network of micro-suppliers and electricity producers may evolve from the proposed Smart Grid infrastructure. The future Intelligent Grid (INGRID) is a step toward the obvious. Development of methodologies using technologies based on rigorous scientific standards must be coupled with effective dissemination of tools and adopted by consumers to acquire real-time monitoring data for analyses and feedback decision support. Automation driven by intelligent systems is key to the efficacy of INGRID. In this essay, we advocate a convergence of innovation through service science, which may evolve in parallel with INGRID, representing an amorphous nexus of engineering and management with the needs of society, industry and government. Higher levels of decision support, necessary both for strategists (policy makers) and engineers (INGRID operators), may be impotent or without global impact if we fail to promote diffusion of a “grass-roots” approach to seed one or more methodologies necessary to acquire data from a critical mass of users in each environmental category (domestic, industrial, hospital) from each major geographical region.",

In the first stage, each of three paths of classification uses each image property (i.e. shape, edge or color based features) independently. In the second stage, a single classifier assigns the category of an image based on the probability distributions of the first stage classifier outputs. Experiments show that the method boosts the classification accuracy over the shape based model.

In large coordination problems, from power grid management to multi-vehicle missions, multiple agents act collectively in order to optimize the performance of the system, while satisfying mission constraints. These optimal plans are particularly susceptible to risk when uncertainty is introduced. We present a distributed planning algorithm that minimizes the system cost while ensuring that the probability of violating mission constraints is below a user-specified level. We build upon the paradigm of risk allocation (Ono and Williams, AAAI-08), in which the planner optimizes not only the sequence of actions, but also its allocation of risk among each constraint at each time step. We extend the concept of risk allocation to multi-agent systems by highlighting risk as a good that is traded in a computational market. The equilibrium price of risk that balances the supply and demand is found by an iterative price adjustment process called tatonnement (also known as Walrasian auction). The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and optimality of the proposed distributed planner.",

Past work on network coordinates has assumed that all nodes in the system behave correctly. The techniques in these systems do not behave well when nodes are Byzantine. These Byzantine failures, wherein a faulty node can behave arbitrarily, can make the coordinate-based distance estimates meaningless. For example, a Byzantine node can delay responding to some other node, thus distorting that node's computation of its own location. We present a network coordinate system based on landmarks, reference nodes that are used for measurements, some of which may be Byzantine faulty. It scales linearly in the number of clients computing their coordinates and does not require excessive network traffic to allow clients to do so.

However, there are few, if any, effective and sufficiently expressive off-the-shelf solvers for string constraints generated by analysis techniques for string-manipulating programs. We designed and implemented Hampi, a solver for string constraints over bounded string variables. Hampi constraints express membership in regular languages and bounded context-free languages. Hampi constraints may contain context-free-language definitions, regular-language definitions and operations, and the membership predicate. Given a set of constraints, Hampi outputs a string that satisfies all the constraints, or reports that the constraints are unsatisfiable. Hampi is expressive and efficient, and can be successfully applied to testing and analysis of real programs. Our experiments use Hampi in: static and dynamic analyses for finding SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web applications; automated bug finding in C programs using systematic testing; and compare Hampi with another string solver. Hampi's source code, documentation, and the experimental data are available at http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/hampi.",

Diesel engine emissions are of particular interest because they are still less understood than gasoline powered internal combustion engines. On the solid side of the exhaust emissions picture, particulates, or Soot and Ash, play the most important part. It has been found that ash is mostly a product of the fuel and oil composition. An oil consumption measuring system is then necessary if the relationship between oil consumption and ash increase in the sump oil and exhaust system is to be properly determined. This Thesis project consisted of experimentally measuring the variation of oil sump composition of a single-cylinder diesel generator set during a continuous running, steady state test. This was measured using ICP-AES (ICP-OES) elemental analysis technique, and the Total Base Number for the oil was also determined. An effective and reduced cost oil consumption and replenishing system was developed with this purpose.(cont.) The oil composition analysis demonstrated that the concentration of inorganic/metallic compounds (Ca, P, Zn, Mg) that contribute to ash increased throughout the test, jointly with oil consumption. The oil consumption measuring system developed was also found to be fairly accurate; with an approximate 2.2% error, probably due to oil hold-up. These results were then used to determine the possible effects of oil composition and oil consumption on Ash emissions and exhaust aftertreatment technologies.",

        "Abstrak": "Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring has been long envisioned to serve as an invaluable tool in the treatment of diabetes. The current invasive method makes it difficult for diabetic patients to perform frequent blood glucose measurements and maintain better control of their glucose levels, crucial in reducing the risks of complications. In this thesis, the use of the near infrared absorption spectroscopy is proposed and investigated. The light radiation is envisioned to be transmitted through thin tissue such as the webbing tissue between the thumb and the index finger. The main technical difficulties are identified to be those caused by complex interferences from other physiological variables and the weak near infrared glucose signals. Thus, the success of such a method hinges on adequately isolating the glucose signals from among the interferences as well as on obtaining high signal-to-noise-ratio spectra. The first objective of this thesis is to provide deeper quantitative understanding to the challenges described above. Such knowledge is key to developing clinically accurate and robust devices. This objective is accomplished through a series of systematic experimental and analytical investigations involving glucose measurements in various biological sample matrices.(cont.) Analytical figures of merit such as \"selectivity\" and \"limit of detection\" are defined, and used to quantify the signal quality and to predict the robustness of the method. The second objective of this thesis is to design an optimum spectroscopic system for the near infrared glucose measurements in the methodically selected band region approximately between 2100 and 2300 nm. A unique, filter spectrometer is developed, which enables spectral signal-to-noise ratio improvement by an order of magnitude over the published data to-date employing top-grade commercial spectrometers, while significantly reducing the required signal acquisition time and hardware complexity. A spectral processing algorithm is developed, which enables the effective removal of spectral variations caused by changes or drifts in the instrument, environment and/or sample conditions, as well as those due to tissue scattering. The spectroscopic system is tested in experiments measuring glucose in synthetic biological solutions, human plasma samples and animal tissue samples. The thesis demonstrates that with a carefully designed system, noninvasive blood glucose measurements using the near infrared absorption spectroscopy is feasible.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis describes the development of two high bandwidth short-stroke rotary fast tool servos and the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator developed for one of them. Design insights, trade-off methodologies, and analytical tools are developed for precision mechanical systems, power and signal electronic systems, control systems, normal-stress electromagnetic actuators, and the dynamics of the combined systems. A fast tool servo (FTS) is a high-speed auxiliary servo axis that is added to a diamond turning machine (ultra-precision lathe) to allow generating free-form non-axisymmetric or textured surfaces on a workpiece. A rotary fast tool servo produces an in-and-out motion of the tool relative to a workpiece by swinging the tool along an arc having a fixed radius. The rotary fast tool servos developed in this project were designed for diamond turning prescription textured surfaces on small spherical workpieces (diameters in the range of 10 mm or less), and are suitable for generating free-form non-axisymmetric surfaces on similar-sized workpieces. Straightforward modifications would allow them to be used on larger workpieces. These rotary fast tool servos set new benchmarks for demonstrated closed-loop bandwidth (2 kHz and 10 kHz) and tool tip acceleration (400 g).(cont.) The first machine, referred to as the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo, uses a commercially available moving-magnet galvanometer as the actuator (Lorentz force), and provides proof-of-principles for a flexure bearing, small diamond tool and mounting method, circuit topology for a high bandwidth current-mode amplifier, and control system design. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo: -3dB bandwidth of 2 kHz, 20 g tool tip acceleration at 2 kHz, maximum tool travel of 50 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 10 nm PP. The 2 kHz FTS is integrated with a diamond turning machine and used to produce optical quality textured surfaces on the face and outside diameter of aluminum workpieces while operating at 2 kHz. The machining tests validate that a rotary-type fast tool servo can be used to produce optical quality surfaces on a spherical workpiece from its pole to its equator. The second machine, referred to as the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, incorporates the proof-of-principles from the first machine and is the vehicle for developing the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator used in it.(cont.) The actuator is a normal-stress variable reluctance machine with a demonstrated order of magnitude increase in the peak torque and in the ratio of peak torque divided by the electrical power at its terminals, when compared to the actuator used in the 2 kHz FTS. By integrating the tool holder directly to the moving mass of the actuator to form a single rigid body, the overall torque-to-inertia ratio for the system and the frequency of the first uncoupled-mass resonance are both increased. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo: -3dB bandwidth of 10 kHz, 400 g tool tip acceleration at 5 kHz, 870 g tool tip acceleration at 10 kHz (aided by a stable mechanical resonance), maximum tool travel of 70 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 1.4 to 2.5 nm rms (depending on the magnitude of the bias flux used). The hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator utilizes a constant bias magnetic flux, which linearizes the torque versus drive-current relationship for the actuator and provides up to half of the torque-producing magnetic flux in the rotor/stator air gaps. The actuator is similar to the rotary actuators used to drive and sustain a resonance in a mechanical oscillator in certain electric engraving heads.(cont.) This research is distinguished from the prior art by the ability to generate closed-loop arbitrary trajectories for the tool tip. Using a separate current-mode amplifier for each stator half allows demonstrating closed-loop control of the rotary and linear degrees of freedom that are inherent in this class of actuators. This research is further distinguished from the prior art by a magnetic circuit that substantially decouples certain magnetic flux paths when a coil is used instead of a permanent magnet to provide the bias magnetic flux. This reduces the complexity of the actuator electrical dynamics from a MIMO system to a SISO system, and allows using loop-shaping techniques with classical control theory to design the control systems. Torque control for the hybrid rotary/linear actuator in the 10 kHz FTS is independent of force control, but force control requires a torque-generating current to act as an operating point. Alternate magnetic circuit topologies that fully decouple torque and force control are described and compared. Future work that utilizes the linear mode as an active suspension for improving the performance of a predominantly rotary system is considered. Using the experience gained by designing, building, and testing the 10 kHz FTS and hybrid rotary/linear actuator, future work involving alternate concepts for the actuator is suggested for a follow-on rotary fast tool servo, and a high bandwidth steering mirror.",

As opposed to steam methane reforming - the most prevalent method of hydrogen production today - there are no carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to other methods of hydrogen production, the efficiency of the cycle is excellent. Due to the high temperatures necessary for the cycle, which are generally greater than 8500C, several of the Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts are attractive thermal energy sources. However, the high temperature and corrosive reaction conditions of the cycle, involving reactions including the decomposition of H2SO4 at 400-9000C, present formidable corrosion challenges. The conversion of sulfuric acid to sulfur dioxide was the focus of this study. The alloying of structural materials to platinum has been proposed as a solution to this problem. A catalytic loop to test the materials was constructed. Sulfuric acid was pumped over the material at 903+20C. The sulfur dioxide production of the catalyst was measured as a means of quantifying the efficiency of the system as a function of temperature.(cont.) The maximum possible production of the material was calculated by using a mass balance. A gas chromatograph was used to calculate the actual production of sulfur dioxide. The results of the experiment show that an molecular conversion efficiency of 10% is attained when operating at 900C while using 800H + 5%Pt as a catalyst. The research confirms the catalytic activity of the material.",

A prototype was built, and benchtop tests were conducted to characterize its force sensitivity, the stability of this force sensitivity, and the jet velocity from the syringe. The force sensitivity was found to be 8.3 N/A, and its consistency was shown to be remarkably stable throughout the stroke of the voice coil. It was found that, with a 200 V input, the voice coil exerted a force of 127 N on the syringe piston, which is equivalent to 12.7 MPa; this pressure produced a jet velocity of 162 m/s out of the syringe.",

A study of the whole supply chain for one specific product from the customer order placement to the customer finished goods (FGs) receipt was performed with the goal of improving the service level by reducing the customer lead time. Specially, the project mapped the customer lead time through studying each process like order handling, production and the FGs delivery.

This thesis focused on learning of the processes and analysis of the customer lead time for one specific product. However, there should be in-depth study of future work to have things improved.

In this work, we present a method for text classification that takes into account document structure and only considers segments that contain information relevant for a classification task. In contrast to the previous work, which assumes that relevance annotation is given, we perform the relevance prediction in an unsupervised fashion. We develop a Conditional Bayesian Network model that incorporates relevance as a hidden variable of a target classifier. Relevance and label predictions are performed jointly, optimizing the relevance component for the best result of the target classifier. Our work demonstrates that incorporating structural information in document analysis yields significant performance gains over bag-of-words approaches on some NLP tasks.",

        "Abstrak": "Environmental performance has become a dominant theme in all transportation sectors. As scientific evidence for global climate change mounts, social and political pressure to reduce fuel burn and C0 2 emissions has increased accordingly, especially in the rapidly growing aviation industry. Operational improvements offer the ability to increase the performance of any aircraft immediately, by simply changing how the aircraft is flown. Cruise phase represents the largest portion of flight, and correspondingly the largest opportunity for fuel burn reduction. This research focuses on the potential efficiency benefits that can be achieved by improving the cruise speed and altitude profiles operated by flights today. Speed and altitude are closely linked with aircraft performance, so optimizing these profiles offers significant fuel burn savings. Unlike lateral route optimization, which simply attempts to minimize the distance flown, speed and altitude changes promise to increase the efficiency of aircraft throughout the entire flight. Flight data was collected for 257 flights during one day of domestic US operations. A process was developed to calculate the cruise fuel burn of each selected flight, based on aircraft performance data obtained from Piano-X and atmospheric data from. NOAA. Improved speed and altitude profiles were then generated for each flight, representing various levels of optimization. Optimal cruise climbs and step climbs of 1,000 and 2,000 ft were analyzed, along with optimal and LRC speed profiles. Results showed that a maximum fuel burn reduction of 3.5% is possible in cruise given complete altitude and speed optimization; this represents 2.6% fuel reduction system-wide, corresponding to 300 billion gallons of jet fuel and 3.2 million tons of CO₂ saved annually. Flights showed a larger potential to improve speed performance, with nearly 2.4% savings possible from speed optimization compared to 1.5% for altitude optimization. Few barriers exist to some of the strategies such as step climbs and lower speeds, making them attractive in the near term. As barriers are minimized, speed and altitude trajectory enhancements promise to improve the environmental performance of the aviation industry with relative ease.",

Through the voices of the men and women involved, this thesis tracks the discovery of HIV from the early outbreak of a deadly epidemic to the design of therapies for a fully-defined disease. When the AIDS outbreak began, doctors and scientists had no idea what was making people sick, and the race to find a cause was a difficult and haphazard process. But it was also a successful one; scientists discovered a definite cause for the disease-the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. However, today there still remain AIDS denialists, people who do not believe HIV is the cause of AIDS. Their beliefs pose the question, why should we trust in science? This version of the history of HIV seeks to answer that question through a particular emphasis on achieving certainty in science, how the steps of the scientific process led to certainty that HIV is the cause of AIDS, through both experimental research and community acceptance.",

        "Abstrak": "Hard drive industry is facing scaling challenge for areal density to be further increased. This is due to the triangular conflictions among thermal stability (superparamagnetic effect), single-to-noise ratio and writability of the recording media. One of the most promising methods to overcome this constraint is the patterned magnetic media technology. Although it is facing many challenges, the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the possible milestones on the horizon for future of the disk drives industry. One of the biggest challenges for patterned media is to realize its mass fabrication provided reduced cost per bit. The basic fabrication approach is to use lithography to pattern the magnetic materials on the platter. However, patterned media requires well-ordered nanoarrays with dimensions less than 25 nm, which challenges the state-of-art lithography technologies. This M. Eng. project focuses on evaluations of the technologies and fabrication schemes potential for patterned media from various aspects like technical barriers, cost and intellectual properties. Technologies including E-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography, templated diblock copolymer self-assembly and self-assembled magnetic nanoparticles are discussed. Cost modeling was done to prove the enormous gain in revenue for the proposed fabrication scheme. It is proposed that the fabrication scheme of templated diblock copolymer for making the master stamp for nanoimprint followed by nanoimprint lithography for mass production has the largest potential for patterned media. However, more R & D is needed for templated self-assembly of diblock copolymer before it is ready for this application.(cont.) E-beam lithography which is a mature technology can also be a choice for making the stamp followed by mass production enabled by nanoimprint lithography, without a significant loss of gain in revenue for ultra-high-density media fabrications. Although the cost of a master stamp fabricated by E-beam is estimated to be 50 times more than for templated self-assembly of diblock copolymer lithography.",

        "Abstrak": "Cells have evolved a highly tuned system for driving growth in response to the right cues. Permissive signals initiate a cascade of events that send nutrient transporters to the membrane, suppress apoptosis, boost protein synthesis, and adjust metabolic processes to fuel the cell's energy demands. Increases in cell growth are often coordinated with cell division, though the two programs can be decoupled. The TOR complexes, TORCI and TORC2, are central regulators of cell growth and share the serine/threonine TOR kinase as their catalytic domain. In mammals, the TORC2 homolog mTORC2 is activated by growth factors through the lipid kinase PI3K, and is a primary effector for many of its functions, including regulation of the proliferation and survival kinase Akt/PKB. Activation of PI3K also leads to activation of mTORC1. Unlike mTORC2, mTORC1 is equally dependent on nutrient availability, and connects to the protein translation machinery through its substrates S6K and 4E-BP1. Additionally, S6K can suppress insulin signaling, establishing a negative feedback loop to PI3K. Consistent with its role in cell growth, derangements in mTOR signaling are increasingly associated with cancer and, more surprisingly, metabolic diseases. In the work described here, we have investigated the mechanism through which insulin activates mTORC1 and identified the protein PRAS40 as a growth factor-regulated inhibitor and mTORC1 component. PRAS40 cooperates with rheb, an mTORC1 activator, to regulate growth factor signaling through the pathway. We have also developed a potent and selective mTORC1/2 small molecule inhibitor and used this to probe the role of mTOR signaling in tumor cell growth and proliferation. Through this, we have identified common genetic mutations that determine sensitivity to mTOR inhibition and suggest a novel therapeutic anticancer strategy.",

Having experienced rapid adoption in ground transportation markets, numerous entities are now investigating opportunities to provide aircraft-based ODM within metropolitan areas. Previous research efforts have focused primarily on the technical capabilities of novel electric propulsion aircraft and sought to characterize the market potential for these vehicles.\r\nThis thesis complements these initial efforts by adopting a broad view of anticipated aircraft-based ODM services to identify operational constraints and evaluate near and far-term mitigation opportunities. A systems-level analysis was used to capture interdisciplinary influence factors such as limitations placed on ODM networks as a result of air traffic control, ground infrastructure integration, network load balancing, unmanned aircraft interaction and community noise, among others. The holistic considerations of this analysis extend beyond the traditional conceptual design disciplines of engineering and business to include evaluative perspective from the legal, policy, urban planning and sustainability domains.\r\nThe first order, systems-level analysis approach for early-phase conceptual design developed in this thesis was applied to a case study in Los Angeles. Promising markets were identified based upon current commuting and wealth patterns. A notional concept of operations was then applied to twelve reference missions within these markets. Scrutiny of these missions revealed a variety of operational challenges from which five preeminent constraints were derived. These constraints may limit or prohibit ODM aircraft operations and include ground infrastructure availability, aircraft noise emissions and air traffic control scalability. Furthermore, significant legal and policy challenges were identified related to low altitude flight, environmental impacts and community acceptance. Findings from this thesis may support the ODM community to develop a system architecting plan that directs technology investments, stakeholder negotiations and network implementation so as to overcome the identified constraints and avoid or internalize negative externalities.",

The transition, necessitated by the degradation of physical and cognitive capability of the elderly, results in drastic increase of cost and rapid decrease of quality of life. A Personal Aid for Mobility and Health Monitoring system (PAMM) has been developed at MIT Field and Space Robotics Laboratory for the elderly living independently or in senior assisted living facilities so as to delay their transition to nursing homes. This thesis research addresses the mobility design and control issues of such devices. Eldercare environments are semi-structured, usually congested, and filled with static and/or dynamic obstacles. Developing effective mobility designs to achieve good maneuverability is a great challenge. An omni-directional mobility concept using conventional wheels has been developed independently in this research. Mobility systems based on this concept are simple, lightweight, energy efficient, and capable of operating on a range of floor surfaces. Assistive mobility devices work in shared workspace and interact directly with their users with limited physical and cognitive capabilities. The users may not be well trained, nor fully understand system. The challenge is to design an ergonomic and intuitive human machine interaction and a control system that can properly allocate control authority between the human and the machine. For this purpose, the admittance-based control methodology is used for the human machine interaction control. An adaptive shared control framework allocates control based on metrics of the demonstrated human performance has been developed.(cont.) Substantial amount of field experiments have been conducted with the actual users to validate control system design. The mobility design and control system implemented and tested on PAMM, will also be applicable to other cooperative mobile robots working in semi-structured indoor environments such as a factory or warehouse.",

        "Abstrak": "Two design methods are explored to reduce vibration, minimize unwanted acoustic noise, and increase stiffness in structures. The first design approach is to create nearly isotropic panels with increased stiffness using two-dimensional curvature. These quasi-isotropic designs can be used in lieu of typical panel reinforcements, and can provide an inexpensive alternative to honeycomb sandwich designs. The second approach is to design panels formed into the shape of a mode shape to reduce detrimental modal dynamics. The effects of combining the two-dimensionally curved designs with constrained layer damping is also investigated. Further, it is also the goal of this research that these panels can be inexpensively manufactured with current manufacturing methods (e.g. stamping, rolling, thermoforming, etc.), resulting in a more effective structural element that does not require significant extra cost or weight. Initial analysis was performed using geometric modeling and finite element analysis. Experimental analysis involved both static and dynamic system identification. The experimental results indicate that quasi-isotropic designs can be accomplished with two-dimensional curvature.(cont.) These quasi-isotropic designs increase the stiffness of a panel and raise the natural frequency by a factor of 2 (compared to a flat panel of the same mass). Although the quasi-isotropic designs have no acoustic benefit, they were shown to be effective replacements as honeycomb cores. The mode-shaped designs demonstrated the unique quality of simultaneously reducing vibration and acoustic noise over a broad frequency range (50-10,000 Hz). The mode-shaped panels demonstrated a factor of 3 increase in the natural frequency, a ten-fold reduction in dynamic deflection displacements, and a 3 to 4 dB RMS reduction in the radiation index over a broad frequency range.",

While many student teams choose methods that are easy-to-use, such as interviews, those teams that choose methods based on their appropriateness found more insightful user-needs information. In addition, through several case studies, it is shown that the teams that choose the more appropriate methods are then more likely to use the gathered user needs and incorporate them into well-designed products.

We show that previous judgments can anchor subsequent ones, even when these are not explicitly compared. We then demonstrate that the effect is caused by the reinterpretation of objective response scales. Much like the use of the label 'very heavy' will depend on its context, we show that the use of labels such as '1000 pounds' will also depend on context. Even though the pounds scale is objectively defined, psychologically it still must be interpreted, and is subject to similar effects as those that influence subjective scales. Essay 2: The Impact of Regular Activities on Well-being Because of people's tendency to adapt, few events in life have a lasting impact on subjective well-being. We suggest that while major events may not provide lasting increases in well-being, certain seemingly minor events - such as attending religious services or exercising - may do so by providing small but frequent boosts. In two studies we demonstrate the existence of such boosts to well-being, and provide evidence that these boosts may be cumulative. We suggest that shifting focus from the impact of major life changes on well-being to the impact of seemingly minor repeated behaviors is crucial for understanding how best to improve well-being. Essay 3: The Doomsday Device: A Mechanism for Avoiding Conflict Arms races are a common occurrence in the business world. In the current paper, we propose that such arms races can be avoided by the use of commitment to an extreme response, and we test this idea experimentally.(cont.)

In order to gain a better understanding of these climate campaigns, I conducted a survey of the climate activities of two transnational NGOs: Friends of the Earth International and Oxfam-Great Britain. In particular, I looked at why these NGOs have engaged in climate change activities in the countries where they are working and why they have oriented their campaigns in the way that they have. The findings suggest that NGO climate change campaigns in industrialized countries focus on mitigation, while the focus in developing countries is on adaptation.",

In its early years, state level political party incentives determined the shelter policies of the Board. The World Bank donated significant amounts of money to the Board for projects in low- income shelter provision between 1975 and 1996, and attempted to significantly change shelter sector policies in the city. However, the Bank faced a great deal of resistance in imposing reforms on the Board. It was not until they radically changed institutional structures within the Board to cut ties with local political parties that they were able to successfully implement policy reform.

Double emulsions formed from immiscible hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons offer a promising platform as reconfigurable micro-optical lenses. These droplet-based lenses can be reconfigured to strongly focusing, nearly transparent, or strongly scattering geometries. The dynamic variation of the lenses' optical interfaces can greatly enhance the lenses' ability to manipulate light. Finite Difference Time Domain and Raytracing techniques were used to characterize the optical properties of the drops and the simulations were verified experimentally immersing the lenses in an aqueous fluorescent medium in order to visualize their light manipulation capabilities. The lenses show a rapid response to external light stimuli or heat gradients and are susceptible to chemical triggers.",

        "Abstrak": "The G8 countries propose a goal of a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050, in an effort that needs to take account of other agreements specifying that developing countries are to be provided with incentives to action and protected from the impact of measures taken by others. To help inform international negotiations of measures to achieve these goals we develop a technique for endogenously estimating the allowance allocations and associated financial transfers necessary to achieve predetermined distributional outcomes and apply it in the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. Possible burden sharing agreements are represented by different allowance allocations (and resulting financial flows) in a global cap-and-trade system. Cases studied include agreements that allocate the burden based on simple allocation rules found in current national proposals and alternatives that specify national equity goals for both developing and developed countries. \r\n\r\nThe analysis shows the ambitious nature of this reduction goal: universal participation will be necessary and the welfare costs can be both substantial and wildly different across regions depending on the allocation method chosen. The choice of allocation rule is shown to affect the magnitude of the task and required emissions price because of income effects. If developing countries are fully compensated for the costs of mitigation then the welfare costs to developed countries, if shared equally, are around 2% in 2020, rising to some 10% in 2050, and the implied financial transfers are large—over $400 billion per year in 2020 and rising to around $3 trillion in 2050. For success in dealing with the climate threat any negotiation of long-term goals and paths to achievement need to be grounded in a full understanding of the substantial amounts at stake.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis examines the syntax of Tagalog with a particular focus on argument structure and its implications for clause structure. Through cross-linguistic comparison I show that Tagalog syntax is not as exotic as is often assumed and that it can be straightforwardly accounted for using available syntactic tools, primarily the theory of phases and Agree of Chomsky (1999, 2001). This study shows that there is no need to appeal to new parameter settings or newcomponents of the grammar in order to account for the syntactic behavior of Tagalog (cf. Sells 1998, Speas 1998, Carrier-Duncan 1985, Kroeger 1993). In this work I show that, contrary to widespread assumptions, the voice system of Tagalog does not reflect the thematic role of the subject argument. Instead, returning to the insight of Ramos 1974, I argue that voice morphology on the verb reflects the case that the subject argument receives in its base position. I also argue that the specificity properties of subjects and objects in Tagalog resemble those motivating object shift in Germanic languages; therefore, I conclude that Tagalog instantiates a system of generalized 'argument shift'. I show that the shift of specific arguments to the edge of the phase is strictly constrained by locality The analysis of voice and locality-constrained shift relies on a detailed study of argument positions in Tagalog. Using tests for hierarchical structure such as reflexive and pronominal variable binding, I examine the structural relations among external arguments, applicative arguments, direct objects, and adjuncts and show them to be in accordance with what is known about structural argument asymmetries cross-linguistically.",

Recent studies on the conversion to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel at the MITR, together with the supporting thermal hydraulic analyses, propose different fuel element designs for optimization of thermal hydraulic performance of the LEU core. Since proposed fuel design has a smaller coolant channel height than the existing HEU fuel, the friction pressure drop is required to be verified experimentally. The objectives of this study are to measure the friction coefficient in both laminar and turbulent flow regions, and to develop empirical correlations for the finned rectangular coolant channels for the safety analysis of the MITR. A friction pressure drop experiment is set-up at the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory, where static differential pressure is measured for both flat and finned coolant channels of various channel heights. Experiment data show that the Darcy friction factors for laminar flow in finned rectangular channels are in good agreement with the existing correlation if a pseudo-smooth equivalent hydraulic diameter is considered; whereas a new friction factor correlation is proposed for the friction factors for turbulent flow. Additionally, a model is developed to calculate the primary flow distribution in the reactor core for transitional core configuration with various combinations of HEU and LEU fuel elements.",

        "Abstrak": "Climate change poses a range of threats to our infrastructure systems. Efforts to respond are complicated by the uncertainty and complexity involved. The uncertainties are pervasive, going beyond scientific and technical issues to include significant governance challenges. This dissertation examines how stakeholders are likely to make project-level decisions in practice, and how we can support better processes. It considers the implications of using multiple scenarios as a way to frame uncertainty, and of bringing multiple stakeholders together for decision-making. It is also concerned with the differences across governance regimes, focusing on Boston, Singapore and Rotterdam. The research process featured a role-play simulation (RPS) exercise run with participants as a way to introduce issues and facilitate experimentation. Participants overwhelmingly favored flexible approaches as a way to proceed despite uncertainties, making the best possible decisions today while leaving options open as conditions change and learning occurs. Unfortunately, this research suggests that there are substantial barriers to institutionalizing flexibility. Participants were also extremely positive on the use of scenarios as a way to frame uncertainty. However, the exercise runs underscored the challenges associated with their use; scenarios encourage users to consider the implications of an uncertain future, but can concurrently deny them the single standards they are familiar with using. Another key finding is that adaptation planning efforts are deliberative processes in which facilitation, the behavior of participants, and process design matter; the choices participants made had significant implications on exercise outcomes. Finally, participants behaved differently across the three cities, underscoring the importance of wider governance norms. This dissertation concludes with three recommendations: First, the development of boundary organizations that can foster the dynamic institutions necessary to advance flexible adaptation. Second, given the importance of salient, credible and legitimate scientific and technical information, I recommend the use of joint fact finding (JFF) techniques. Because of the dynamic nature of climate adaptation, I suggest that JFF be explicitly iterative in nature. Scenarios can help JFF groups to consider the uncertainties involved. Third, I recommend that researchers consider using exercises as tools for action research, particularly when considering nascent and complex issues like climate adaptation.",

In order to be able to structure the most effective plan for a specific worksite, it is necessary to understand the factors that determine commuter response to company incentives to change commuting habits. This study compares the predictive ability of neural networks compared to linear regression models in calculating the change in vehicle trip rate (VTR) at a given worksite over a year long travel plan period. Using a Los Angeles area dataset (n = 3439), linear regression and neural network models were constructed and optimized using input variables including worksite incentives, business type and number of years of incentives at the worksite. Significant differences(p=0.006, 0.007) in program effectiveness were discovered between the results of local authority worksites ([delta]VTR = -1.495) and both businesses ([delta]VTR = -0.986) and hospitals ([delta]VTR = -0.728). It was determined that the neural network (R² = 0.229) performed better than the linear regression models (R² = 0.038) when evaluated by R², representing an improvement of 0.014 on previous models.(cont.) However, when measuring the ability of the models to predict within a certain interval around the output the linear regression models outperformed the neural network model by a factor of 35 percentage points. The lack of strong linear correlations between the inputs and the outputs of these models suggests that the most significant factors in creating successful transportation demand management programs are not currently being tracked. Given the statistically significant superior performance at local authority worksites it is suggested that more worksite demographics are tracked.",

The paradigm of how companies must perform has dramatically changed over the years. Back in the 1980's customer service was used as a tool to gain competitive advantage. Now, good customer service is expected from the vendor and few companies survive if they don't embrace best of breed practices such as this one. In addition, quality, cost and delivery time have become intrinsic values for the consumer. Not only does the product need to be at a lower cost but they also need to be of higher quality and be delivered promptly. Instron Corporation is one of the companies that is searching for ways to remain as the industry leader given the fierce competition they face. This company sells electromechanical testing machines and has a large after market for accessories for these machines. While the company has placed a lot of effort into certain areas, others have been completely neglected. This project will focus on the accessory business of the electromechanical systems. The intent has been to identify the major problems that the accessory business faces and provide the company with a set of tools and guidelines that will help the company perform more effectively. Due to time constraints, the research was done on one segment of the accessory business, the grips. Therefore, this thesis should be used as a template for the rest of the accessory business. Topics included are; product rationalization, redesign with product platforms, and an inventory model to reduce existing inventory investments and increase inventory turns.",

The incorporation of hexafluoroisopropanol, a strong and stable dipolar group, to the polythiophene backbone enhances the solubility and especially, the hydrogen bond forming capabilities of the polymer. This functionalization enables the polymer to build up an isotropic self-supporting network structure based on a combination of polymer-polymer chain interactions and interchain hydrogenbondings. These thermally reversible physical crosslinks incorporate plasticity in the conjugated polymer gel. The gel network can be melted and then transformed via mechanical deformation to form an anisotropic gel with the chains highly aligned along the tensile direction. The oriented gel morphology comprises a distribution of crystalline clusters in an overall swollen network. In these ordered regions, conjugated backbones are [pi]-stacked with respect to each other neighbors. The mechanically induced structural rearrangement from an isotropic to an anisotropic conjugated polymer gel occurs when transitioning from the molten state to the gel state. This study highlights the versatility of incorporating plasticity in the design of conjugated polymer materials via a gel processing technology and its potential for applications.",

Inbound relays increase the utilization of private fleet on the inbound lanes while outbound relays shift the private fleet capacity between neighboring DCs. Together, inbound and outbound relays better utilize existing private fleet resources and can be used to justify an investment in a larger private fleet through the purchase of addition tractors and trailers.",

        "Abstrak": "Porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), also known as porous alumina, is a self-ordered nanostructured material well-suited for use in electronic, magnetic, optical and biological applications due to its small pore size (4-200nm) and spacing (10-500nm). Under slightly acidic conditions, both oxidation and dissolution of aluminum leads to the formation of pores. AAO pores form a self-assembled honey-comb structure with short range order over certain ranges of anodic potential and pH. In this work, three key results related to porous AAO science and technology are presented. First, a new theory based on strain-induced instability has been developed from the analysis of results obtained from kinetic studies and stress measurements to explain the formation of AAO pores. Experiments show that excess vacancies of aluminum, created by the dissolution process, generate a large tensile stress and an associated strain energy, which destabilizes the initially flat A1/AAO interface and leads to pore formation. Other factors affecting stability of the Al/AAO interface and the self-assembly process are also presented.(cont.) Second, templated self-assembly (TSA) of AAO pores, ordered over wafer-scale areas and with controlled spacing and symmetry, have been achieved by pre-patterning the substrate using interference lithography. TSA of AAO pores led to control of pore spacing and order symmetry in ranges not achievable without templating. Independent control of pore spacing and diameter were successfully demonstrated, allowing formation of novel 3-D nanostructures such as nanofunnels, fabricated using periodic variations in the anions and/or electrolyte pH. Using the TSA approach, AAO with ordered pores <35nm in diameter and aspect ratios >50:1 were fabricated on Si substrates. A 1-D array of ordered pores, either in or out of plane with the substrate, was fabricated by confining the growth of AAO pores using silicon oxide masks patterned by lithography techniques. Finally, AAO templates were used to fabricate ordered nanostructures including carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanotubes and antidots, and metallic nanowires and nanoparticles, all of which display properties very different from their bulk counterparts.(cont.) These results, and other proposed methodologies, provide new techniques for controlled in-plane and out-of-plane growth and organization of nanotubes and nanowires on Si substrates.",

This approach uses a contact position distribution from a generic particle filter to estimate the state of a single moving contact and to plan the path that minimizes the uncertainty in the location of the contact. The search algorithms introduced in this thesis will implement a motion planner that searches for a contact with the following information available to the decision system: (1) null measurement (i.e., contact not detected at current time), (2) timedated measurement (i.e., clue found at current time that indicates contact was at this location in the past), and (3) bearings measurement (i.e., angular measurement towards contact position detected at current time). The results of this thesis will be arrived at by evaluating the best methods to utilize the three types of information. The underlying distribution of the contact state space will be modeled using a generic particle filter, due to the highly non-Gaussian distributions that result from the conditions mentioned above. Using the particle filter distribution and the measurements acquired from the three conditions, this thesis will work towards implementing a path planning algorithm that creates dynamic action spaces that evaluate the uncertainty of position distribution. Ultimately, the path planner will choose the path that contains the position distribution and leads to sustained searches.",

This study presents a detailed analysis of advanced composite rods (comprised of two or more distinct axial sections of different materials) using theoretical ultrasonic NDE. In anticipation of the high elastic moduli of the rods (relative to many metals) along their longitudinal axes, a one-dimensional wave propagation analysis will be conducted. By analyzing the propagation of ultrasonic waves in nondispersive media and the corresponding reflections and transmissions at structural interfaces, assessments of interfacial debonding will be explored and the presence of anomalous materials can be demonstrated. The resulting graphical presentations will be compiled and should provide the basis for material characterizations and assessments of structural integrity throughout the rods.",

        "Abstrak": "The town halt as a type of architecture has become so prevalent that the term has been used to describe the activities that go on inside - namely, social gatherings of the public for purposes of discussion, question, and feedback to the governing body. The archetypes of the town hall, in the 12th century Italy, or 17th century New England, functioned not only as the municipal headquarters with offices and courts, but also in some cases included markets, church, warehouse, museum, pub, etc. Most importantly, it functioned as a meeting place for the public. However, as an architecture typology, the town hall does not scale as the municipality expands. The administrative parts of the town hall can grow or multiply proportionally with the population, but the public functions that were originally embedded in the architecture were either pushed out into the large plaza outside of the city hall, or disappeared entirely. This thesis project seeks to re-establish the ideologies of democracy manifested through the architectural typology of the town hall in New York City's Civic Center through creating small spaces for social discourse.",

        "Abstrak": "In the first part, we study the problem of minimizing a separable concave function over a polyhedron. We assume the concave functions are nonnegative nondecreasing on R+, and the polyhedron is in RI' (these assumptions can be relaxed further under suitable technical conditions). We show how to approximate this problem to 1+ E precision in optimal value by a piecewise linear minimization problem so that the number of resulting pieces is polynomial in the input size of the original problem and linear in 1/c. For several concave cost problems, the resulting piecewise linear problem can be reformulated as a classical combinatorial optimization problem. As a result of our bound, a variety of polynomial-time heuristics, approximation algorithms, and exact algorithms for classical combinatorial optimization problems immediately yield polynomial-time heuristics, approximation algorithms, and fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the corresponding concave cost problems. For example, we obtain a new approximation algorithm for concave cost facility location, and a new heuristic for concave cost multi commodity flow. In the second part, we study several concave cost problems and the corresponding combinatorial optimization problems. We develop an algorithm design technique that yields a strongly polynomial primal-dual algorithm for a concave cost problem whenever such an algorithm exists for the corresponding combinatorial optimization problem.(cont.) Our technique preserves constant-factor approximation ratios as well as ratios that depend only on certain problem parameters, and exact algorithms yield exact algorithms. For example, we obtain new approximation algorithms for concave cost facility location and concave cost joint replenishment, and a new exact algorithm for concave cost lot-sizing. In the third part, we study a real-time optimization problem arising in the operations of a leading internet retailer. The problem involves the assignment of orders that arrive via the retailer's website to the retailer's warehouses. We model it as a concave cost facility location problem, and employ existing primal-dual algorithms and approximations of concave cost functions to solve it. On past data, we obtain solutions on average within 1.5% of optimality, with running times of less than 100ms per problem.",

        "Abstrak": "Conflict-directed search algorithms have formed the core of practical, model-based reasoning systems for the last three decades. In many of these applications there is a series of discrete constraint optimization problems and a conflict-directed search algorithm, which uses conflicts in the forward search step to focus search away from known infeasibilities and towards the optimal solution. In the arena of model-based autonomy, discrete systems, like deep space probes, have given way to more agile systems, such as coordinated vehicle control, which must robustly control their continuous dynamics. Controlling these systems requires optimizing over continuous, as well as discrete variables, using linear and non-linear as well as logical constraints. This thesis explores the development of algorithms for solving ybrid discrete/linear optimization problems that use conflicts in the forward search direction, generalizing from the conflict-directed search algorithms of based reasoning. We introduce a novel algorithm called Generalized Conflict-directed Branch and Bound (GCD-BB). GCD-BB extends traditional Branch and Bound (B&B), by first constructing conflicts from nodes of the search tree that are found to be infeasible or sub-optimal, and then by using these conflicts to guide the forward search away from known infeasible and sub-optimal states. We evaluate GCD-BB empirically on a range of test problems of coordinated air vehicle control. GCD-BB demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance compared to a traditional B&B algorithm, applied to either disjunctive linear programs or an equivalent binary integer program encoding.",

        "Abstrak": "Most unmanned missions in space and undersea are commanded by a \"script\" that specifies a sequence of discrete commands and continuous actions. Currently such scripts are mostly hand-generated by human operators. This introduces inefficiency, puts a significant cognitive burden on the engineers, and prevents re-planning in response to environment disturbances or plan execution failure. For discrete systems, the field of autonomy has elevated the level of commanding by developing goal-directed systems, to which human operators specify a series of temporally extended goals to be accomplished, and the goal-directed systems automatically output the correct, executable command sequences. Increasingly, the control of autonomous systems involves performing actions with a mix of discrete and continuous effects. For example, a typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission involves discrete actions, like get GPS and take sample, and continuous actions, like descend and ascend, which are influenced by the dynamical model of the vehicle. A hybrid planner generates a sequence of discrete and continuous actions that achieve the mission goals. In this thesis, I present a novel approach to solve the generative planning problem for temporally extended goals for hybrid systems, involving both continuous and discrete actions. The planner, Kongming, incorporates two innovations. First, it employs a compact representation of all hybrid plans, called a Hybrid Flow Graph, which combines the strengths of a Planning Graph for discrete actions and Flow Tubes for continuous actions. Second, it engages novel reformulation schemes to handle temporally flexible actions and temporally extended goals. I have successfully demonstrated controlling an AUV in the Atlantic ocean using mission scripts solely generated by Kongming. I have also empirically evaluated Kongming on various real-world scenarios in the underwater domain and the air vehicle domain, and found it successfully and efficiently generates valid and optimal plans.",

The research presented here explores possible avenues of \r\nenhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single \r\noperator. This project specifically evaluates the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as \r\nindicators of course deviations or late arrivals to targets for UAV missions.  It also looks at the \r\nvalue of the audio cues in single and multiple UAV scenarios.   \r\n \r\nTo this end, an experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle \r\nExperimental (MAUVE) test bed developed in the Humans and Automation Laboratory at the \r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous \r\naudio alerts were mapped to two human supervisory tasks within MAUVE.  One of the \r\ncontinuous audio alerts, an oscillating course deviation alert was mapped to UAV course \r\ndeviations which occurred over a continual scale.  The other continuous audio alert tested was a \r\nmodulated late arrival alert which alerted the operator when a UAV was going to be late to a \r\ntarget.  In this case the continuous audio was mapped to a discrete event in that the UAV was \r\neither on time or late to a target.  The audio was continuous in that it was continually on and \r\nalerting the participant to the current state of the UAV.  It either was playing a tone indicating \r\nthe UAV was on time to a target or playing a tone indicating the UAV was late to a target.  These \r\ncontinuous alerts were tested against more traditional single beep alerts which acted as discrete \r\nalerts.  The beeps were discrete in that when they were used for monitoring course deviations a \r\nsingle beep was played when the UAV got to specific threshold off of the course or for late \r\narrivals a single beep was played when the UAV became late. \r\n \r\nThe results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator’s \r\nperformance in monitoring single and multiple semi-autonomous vehicles.  However, the results \r\nalso emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with the other auditory \r\nalarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be lost \r\nin aural saliency of continuous audio, leaving operators reliant on the visual aspects of the \r\ndisplay.",

The negative \r\nimpacts of interruptions are well documented and include increased task completion and \r\nerror rates in individual task activities, as well as interference with team coordination in \r\nteam-based activities.  The ramifications of an interruption in mission control operations, \r\nsuch as military command and control and emergency response, can be particularly costly \r\ndue to the time and life-critical nature of these operations.  The negative impacts of \r\ninterruptions have motivated recent developments in software tools, called interruption \r\nrecovery tools, which help mitigate the effects of interruptions in a variety of task \r\nenvironments.  However, mission control operations introduce particular challenges for \r\nthe design of these tools due to the dynamic and highly collaborative nature of these \r\nenvironments.  \r\nTo address this issue, this report investigates methods of reducing the negative \r\nconsequences of interruptions in complex, mission control operations.  In particular, this \r\nreport focuses on supporting interruption recovery for team supervisors in these \r\nenvironments, as the research has shown that supervisors are particularly susceptible to \r\nfrequent interruptions.  Based on the results of a requirements analysis, which involved a \r\ncognitive task analysis of a representative mission control task scenario, a new \r\ninterruption recovery tool, named the Interruption Recovery Assistance (IRA) tool, was \r\ndeveloped.  In particular, the IRA tool was designed to support a military mission \r\ncommander overseeing a team of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators performing \r\nground force protection operations.  The IRA tool provides the mission commander a \r\nvisual summary of mission changes, in the form of an event bookmark timeline.  It also \r\nprovides interactive capabilities to enable the commander to view additional information \r\non the primary task displays when further detail about a particular mission event is \r\nneeded. \r\nThe report also presents the findings from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the \r\neffectiveness of the IRA tool on interruption recovery during collaborative UAV mission \r\noperations. The study produced mixed results regarding the effectiveness of the IRA tool.  \r\nThe statistical analysis indicated a negative impact on recovery time, while indicating a \r\npositive impact on decision accuracy, especially in complex task situations.  The study \r\nalso indicated that the effect of the IRA tool varied across differ user populations.  In \r\nparticular, the IRA tool tended to provide greater benefits to participants without military \r\nexperience, compared to military participants involved in the study.  The qualitative \r\nfindings from the study provided key insights into the impact and utility of the IRA tool.  \r\nThese insights were used to identify several future research and design directions related \r\nto interruption recovery in mission control operations.",

The work detailed in this study focuses on the cloning and characterization of a novel E2F family member, E2F6. E2F6 bears some sequence homology to the other E2Fs in the DP dimerization and DNA binding domains, but there is a high degree of divergence outside of those domains. Additionally, although the DP dimerization and DNA binding properties of E2F6 are similar to those of the other E2F family members, it is not regulated by the pocket proteim family and it is unable to activate transcription. Instead, it can act to repress the transcription of E2F responsive genes by countering the activity of the other E2F complexes. Therefore, E2F6 represents a new subclass of the E2F family. In an effort to more fully understand the mechanism behind the repressive abilities of E2F6, we screened for interacting proteins. RYBP, a member of the mammalian polycomb group, was identified by yeast-two-hybrid analysis as an E2F6-interacting protein. The RYBP-binding domain on E2F6 was highly conserved among all the E2F proteins, but the interaction was nevertheless specific to E2F6. In addition, E2F6 can associate with several other members of the polycomb transcriptional repression complex, including Ringla, Mel-18, mphl, and the oncogene Bmi1. Moreover, overexpression of E2F6 leads to a similar downregulation of p19ARF as exogenous Bmi1. These findings suggest that the biological properties of E2F6 could be mediated through its ability to recruit the polycomb complex.(cont.) Finally, the presence of E2F6 in mammalian polycomb complexes sheds insight into how these complexes might bind to DNA.",

        "Abstrak": "Programmed cell death plays an important part in metazoan development as well as in disease. The morphology of cells undergoing programmed cell death has been carefully defined and found to be conserved between a variety of species. A number of key regulators of this process were first identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and then found to be conserved in Drosophila and mammals. In addition to the conserved components of the programmed cell death pathway, Drosophila contains three currently novel regulators: reaper, head involution defective (hid), and grim. The C. elegans gene ced-4 is necessary for the proper execution of programmed cell deaths during development. A mammalian homolog, Apaf-1, has similar functions. Until recently, a Drosophila homolog for this component of the core cell death pathway had not been identified. We describe the cloning and characterization of a Drosophila ced-4/Apaf-l homolog, which we named hac-1. HAC-1, like CED-4 and Apaf-1 is required for some cell deaths during development, can help activate caspases in vitro, and appears to aid in the activation of procaspases overexpressed in the Drosophila eye. Interestingly, like reaper, hac-1 transcription is rapidly upregulated in response to UV and X-irradiation. An essential regulator of programmed cell death in Drosophila is diap 1. Diap1 is part of a conserved family of Inhibitor of Anoptosis proteins (IAPs) that were first described in baculovirus. Loss of diap1 function results in widespread apoptosis during early embryonic development. In addition to the morphological features of apoptosis, caspases are activated and physiological caspase substrates are cleaved. We show that some of the morphological changes observed can be explained by the cleavage of two caspase substrates, nuclear Lamin Dffio and Armadillo. In order to identify additional components of the programmed cell death pathway and to further our understanding of how Reaper functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interactor screen using Reaper as the bait. We isolated ten potential interactors for which we determined the sequence, expression pattern, and cytological map position. None of these interactors has yet been shown to function in programmed cell death, but they provide leads to follow for future investigation.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis describes the identification and characterization of a novel gene, GRP50 (Golgi-associated ankyrin repeat protein of 50 kilodaltons), which encodes a highly conserved mammalian protein exhibiting a unique structural architecture. Homology searching tools reveal that no known orthologues of this protein have been identified in other species, indicating that it is not a member of a previously characterized family. GRP50 is abundantly expressed in fetal tissues and in adult brain, and is induced as part of the serum response in cultured primary fibroblasts. Sequence analysis indicates that GRP50 encodes a medium-sized protein with multiple modular domains, including an ankyrin repeat region, a polyproline-rich region, and a leucine-rich region that may form c-helical coiled coils. Each of these domains has been shown in other proteins to function as a protein-protein interaction module. We have used immunolocalization techniques to show that GRP50 is peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic face of Golgi and vesicle membranes in cultured mammalian fibroblasts. Further, we have demonstrated that Golgi-association of GRP50 is sensitive to the effects of the fungal metabolite, Brefeldin A. In biochemical fractionation experiments, GRP50 was purified from cultured cells as part of a large macromolecular complex. The possible roles of GRP50 in biological events at the cytoplasmic face of Golgi and vesicle membranes are discussed.",

The objectives of this work were to develop a method to determine the Preston constants and to measure the Preston constants of four low-dielectric-constant (low-k) polymers, labeled A, B, C, and D, and Cu. A weight-loss method, which measures the weight difference between the initial wafer and the polished wafer, provided repeatable results. The Preston constants ranged from 1.01 to 5.96 x10-'3 m2/N. The variation in measurements of the Preston constant ranged from 16% to 31%. The Preston constant of Cu was found to be 1.60 + 0.50 x10-13 m2/N. Of the four polymers, Polymer A had the smallest Preston constant, 1.01 i- 0.30 x10-13 m2/N. It was also determined that there is an approximate inverse linear relationship between the Preston constant of the four low-k polymers and their Young's moduli of elasticity. An approximate inverse linear relationship between the Preston constant of the four low-k polymers and the hardness was also observed.",

        "Abstrak": "The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and the closely related p107 and p130 proteins play important roles in the regulation of both tumorigenesis and tissue-specific differentiation. To determine the role of Rb in development more precisely, we analyzed chimeric embryos and adults made with marked Rb-/- cells. We demonstrated that although brains of chimeric embryos exhibited extensive ectopic S-phase entry, unlike in germline Rb-/- littermates, in these chimeras the majority of Rb-deficient cells survived and differentiated into neuronal fates. Therefore, the role of Rb during development can be divided into a cell-autonomous function in exit from the cell cycle and a non-cell autonomous role in the suppression of apoptosis and induction of differentiation. Rb-/- ES cells were also able to efficiently differentiate into neurons in vitro. However, similarly to the situation observed in the chimeric embryos, Rb-/- neuronal cells failed to properly exit the cell cycle and continued to progress through the S-phase, while displaying fully differentiated neuronal morphology and expressing mature neuronal markers. Therefore, Rb function is not required for the commitment to the neuronal lineage or progression of neuronal differentiation but necessary for the cell cycle exit of differentiating neurons. In agreement, in wild-type differentiating ES cells, activity of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) was increased specifically at the time of neuronal precursor cell cycle exit.(cont.) In differentiating Rb-/- ES cells, levels of the pRB-related p107 protein were specifically elevated, suggesting that it might be substituting for pRB to allow efficient neuronal differentiation. In order to determine if p107 and p130 proteins might play a role in tissue-specificity of tumorigenesis upon loss of Rb, we investigated the function of these proteins in the mouse pituitary tumors. Both p107 and p130 were present and active in primary pituitary tumors but levels of p107 were very low while protein levels if pocket-family targets, E2F 1 and E2F 4 were elevated. Although normally bound exclusively to E2F 4, in pituitary tumors p107 and p130 were able to form complexes also with E2F 1. Therefore, in the absence of pRB, p107 and p130 are able to bind and may regulate the function of the activating E2F species. Despite this partial substitution, p107 and p130 are unable to prevent pituitary tumorigenesis in Rb+'- mice, likely due to the elevated E2F expression. The levels of expression of the pRB- versus the E2F-family proteins in different tissues might be contributing to the sensitivity of these tissues to tumor development upon loss of Rb.",

These adhesions can cause pain, discomfort , inflammation, anxiety, depression, problems with conception, trouble eating, and decreased immune function. There are around 300,000 hospital admissions in the U.S. every year for patients due to adhesions.. Part of the problem is that there is no suitable method to diagnose adhesions. Recently there have been a number of studies which suggest that measuring visceral slides under ultrasound using exaggerated respiration may prove to be very promising in diagnosing adhesions non invasively. Yet there are still weaknesses in the predictive power of these procedures. For such procedures to be successfully implemented into clinical medicine and offer non invasive methods to diagnosing adhesions, they must first be able to offer higher percentage predictive values. We have worked on a number of models of an external abdominal vacuum system which we believe will increase the accuracy and predictive values of measuring visceral slides under ultrasound using exaggerated respiration.",

A key component of the improvement strategy is the ability to define appropriate manufacturing yield goals. Cisco's manufacturing operations can be divided, at a very high level, in two major steps: Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) and System Assembly and Test. The company has already deployed a global yield goal definition methodology for the PCBA operation, but the creation of a similar methodology for the System Assembly and Test operation proved difficult: Cisco lacked a universal methodology to determine the expected variation on manufacturing performance resulting from differences on product design and manufacturing processes attributes. This thesis addresses this gap by demonstrating a methodology to relate relevant design and process attributes to the System Assembly and Test manufacturing yield performance of all products. The methodology uses statistical analysis, in particular Artificial Neural Networks, to generate a yield prediction model that achieves excellent prediction accuracy (4.8% RMS error). Although this study was performed using Cisco Systems' product and manufacturing data, the general process outlined in this exercise should be applicable to solve similar problems in other companies and industries. The core components of the methodology outlined can be easily reproduced: 1) identify the key complexity attributes, 2) design and execute a data collection plan and 3) generate statistical models to test the validity and impact of the selected factors.",

        "Abstrak": "In this study, we examine the process of \"late standardization,\" in which latecomers engage in standards activities in order to move towards and beyond the technological frontier. Based on case studies of latecomers in the semiconductor and mobile telecommunication industries in South Korea and Thailand, we analyze the strategic, organizational, and institutional aspects of the late-standardization process. We hypothesize that latecomer firms and states must engage in standards activities to progress beyond catch-up, because standards are a prerequisite to technological development. Standards are strategic leverages that allow latecomers to link with and learn from technology leaders. Specifically, latecomer firms have to engage internally in quality standardization to take advantage of latecomer advantages. Quality standards help improve production capability, while enhancing credibility and reputation. Without quality control, latecomers cannot become part of global value chains and have difficulty in acquiring advanced technologies from forerunners. As latecomers become fast followers, they have to participate in external standardization. The goal is to acquire knowledge about emerging technologies and standards.(cont.) By linking with and learning from forerunners, fast followers enhance second-mover advantages derived from ramp-up capability. Once their R&D efforts bear fruit and they become technology leaders, advanced \"late standardizers\" have to lead external standardization efforts. This would enable them to exploit innovation capability and gain first-mover advantages derived from proprietary technologies and learning-curve effects. As latecomers move towards the technological frontier, standards activities become the core of research and development strategy and policy. They also adjust organizational structures and human resource management to accommodate standards efforts. The state plays critical yet changing roles throughout the late-standardization process. It sets up standards institutions and provides \"infratechnologies\" for quality control. The state also mitigates technology and market risks associated with new standards, while facilitating networking among late-standardizing firms. As late standardizers become technology and standards leaders, the state pursues \"standards diplomacy\" for overseas adoption of its domestic standards, while strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights.",

        "Abstrak": "In this thesis we address the problem of determining in situ stress and fracture properties in reservoirs using borehole logs and surface seismic reflection data. The dissertation covers four subtopics. The first is the determination of horizontal stress magnitudes from measurements in a borehole. Two types of data used are stress-induced rock failures in the borehole, known as \"breakouts,\" and the dispersions of polarized flexural waves which propagate along the borehole. Traditionally these data are analyzed to derive stress orientations but not magnitudes. To determine the magnitude of stresses directly from breakouts, we use an iterative elastic modeling of stresses around the borehole and Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion to match the borehole deformation. As a second method we use dispersion curves of the two polarized flexural waves and their crossover points. These methods are applied to data from a well in northeastern Venezuela. The combination of these two techniques provides a complete profile of stress as a function of depth since the first method is applied at the breakout depths and the second is applied everywhere else in the borehole. Both borehole methods agree in the estimation of stress orientation and magnitude. The maximum horizontal stress is in the NNW-SSE direction, in agreement with a regional stress model calculated from the relative motions of the Caribbean and South America plates. The magnitudes of principal stresses are on average, SHmax 1.1Sv (Sv: vertical stress) and Shmin 0.9Sv (Shmin: minimum horizontal stress). This suggests strike-slip faulting, consistent with earthquake mechanisms in the region. The in situ stresses play an important role on determining the properties of fractured formation. The azimuth of SHmax determines the preferred orientation of open fractures. Surface seismic reflection data provide the means for detecting the fractures.(cont.) The second contribution of this thesis is developing a method to detect discrete fractures, and to determine their orientation and average spacing. We developed a novel and practical technique, called the F-K method, based on the frequency wavenumber (f-k) domain analysis of seismic coda. The fractured medium targeted in this study is a network of rather regularly spaced, parallel, sub-vertical fractures, with dimensions similar to seismic wavelength. The seismic response of a fractured medium is studied by finite difference numerical models for a variety of situations where orientation, spacing, height, and fracture compliance are varied. In the direction normal to fractures, scattered waves propagate with slower apparent velocities than waves propagating along the fractures. The orientation of fractures is well constrained from the azimuthal dependence of scattering. The spectral characteristics (frequency, wavenumber and amplitude) of the backscattered waves are related to fracture properties like spacing, compliance, and height. The dominant wavenumber is very sensitive to fracture spacing. We use the F-K method to analyze a data set from the Lynx Field in Canada. Characterization of fracture properties in this field is important for development plans to maximize the gas production. In the field data, the acquisition geometry results in irregular fold, with under sampling of certain azimuths and offsets. We address the acquisition footprint issue by controlling the azimuth binning of the data and neglecting the low/irregular fold gathers in the fracture analysis. We also apply the Scattering Index (SI) method (Willis et al., 2006) to the same data from the Lynx Field. The SI method is a robust method to detect fractures and to provide fracture orientations using multi-azimuth/multi-offset pre-stack data. In the realm of existing 3D seismic surveys, data with such acquisition characteristics are few.(cont) The fourth contribution of this thesis is therefore the conception of a post-stack version of the SI method that extends the scope of this method to practically every 3D seismic surface data set. In this version, a scattering index is computed for a fully stacked trace per CMP gather. As long as the bin contains traces parallel to the fracture strike, the stacking process of all azimuths and offsets preserves the reverberating character introduced by the fractures. The post-stack SI at a fractured location has a large value in comparison to a non-fractured location. The variations of post-stack SI values across the field reveal the distribution of highly fractured areas. Fracture strike cannot be determined in this case because it does not include the azimuthal behavior of the scattering. However, the results from the post-stack SI are helpful to identify areas of interest to focus the more specialized scattering analysis methods. We apply the F-K and SI methods to the Lynx Field seismic data and compare the results. Since spatial resolution of the two methods are different we upscale the SI maps to match the resolution of the F-K method. The combined analysis of the Lynx Field indicates that the preferred fracture orientation is N400E, which agrees with the regional stress field. The distribution of highly fractured regions appears to be associated to the geological features, such as folds and faults. The average fracture spacing, obtained by the F-K method shows that, in the Lynx Field, fracture spacing decreases in the west side of the field where the structural dips are higher.",

Traditionally, decision-making power in urban redevelopment projects resided between the public and private sectors, with little authority given to communities. The development of Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) were a reaction to this imbalance and have helped communities gain influence in the redevelopment process. These agreements are \"legally\" binding contracts between a developer and community group(s) - to ensure that development projects benefit local community residents. Their creation is rooted in several decades of failed urban policies and the public learning that has taken place since Urban Renewal. CBAs first appeared in Los Angeles in 2001 and have since taken root across the country in such geographically diverse places as Denver, Milwaukee, and New York City. These agreements represent a significant evolution in collective bargaining, the ability of varied entities to come together and take a common position on a topic, and the ability of communities to secure benefits from developers. This thesis examines why these agreements came into existence, the process by which they are implemented, and how they have been employed. It will look at how these agreements have created greater overall value for all three sectors involved in publicly subsidized redevelopment projects and how to improve upon the community benefits negotiation process.",

        "Abstrak": "Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, relationships between tons of emissions abated and the CO2 (or GHG) price, have been widely used as pedagogic devices to illustrate simple economic concepts such as the benefits of emissions trading. They have also been used to produce reduced form models to examine situations where solving the more complex model underlying the MAC is difficult. Some important issues arise in such applications: (1) are MAC relationships independent of what happens in other regions? (2) are MACs stable through time regardless of what policies have been implemented in the past?, and (3) can one approximate welfare costs from them? This paper explores the basic characteristics of MAC and marginal welfare cost (MWC) curves, deriving them using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We find that, depending on the method used to construct them, MACs are affected by policies abroad. They are also dependent on policies in place in the past and depend on whether they are CO2-only or include all GHGs. Further, we find that MACs are, in general, not closely related to MWCs and therefore should not be used to derive estimates of welfare change. It would be a great convenience if a reduced-form response of a more complex model could be used to reliably conduct empirical analysis of climate change policy, but it appears that, at least as commonly constructed, MACs may be unreliable in replicating results of the parent model when used to simulate GHG policies. This is especially true if the policy simulations differ from the conditions under which the MACs were simulated. Care is needed to derive MACs under conditions closely related to the policy under consideration. In such a circumstance they may provide approximate estimates of CO2 or GHG prices for a given policy constraint. They remain a convenient way to visualize responses to a range of abatement levels.",

        "Abstrak": "Microcontact printing uses elastomeric stamps to transfer ink onto a substrate by the process of self-assembly. It has the capability to print features as small as 200nm over large areas. Because of this it has many potential industrial applications in areas such as the manufacture of flexible displays and electronics. Roll to roll is the best model for the commercialization of microcontact printing since it offers advantages such as high throughput, convenient material handling and conformal contact propagation. We have designed and built a tool to study the behavior of microcontact printing in a roll to roll paradigm, with the three fold objective of printing at high speeds, over large areas and obtaining good quality. This thesis emphasizes the experimental part of our project. We have obtained results as low as 28 microns over areas of 5.8\"x5\" and tight dimensional distributions within 1 micron. According to our results, there is no evidence that the printing load and printing speed have any effect on the printing quality. We have been able to print at speeds as high as 400 fpm with contact times of 7 ms, over 8\"x 8\", albeit with defects such as air trapping at very high speeds. We have also built a prototype to demonstrate continuous etching as an accompanying process.",

        "Abstrak": "This dissertation looks at the political role of trade unions in developing countries. Trade unions and particularly their engagement in political unionism have been absent from the development literature in recent decades. However, recently there has been a renewed interest in the role of trade unions and particularly in their political role as trade union movements in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil have effectuated regime change by assisting labour based political parties to rise to power. I contribute to this trend by studying the role of the Congress of South African Trade unions (COSATU) and their role in shaping South Africa's transition to democracy. I use the story of COSATU to build on a theory of political unionism that is encompasses the various economic, social and political roles of trade unions and their strategic capability in capturing gains for workers.I examine COSATUs political role by creating five analytical categories to study the federations' experience; a historical review of the Black trade union movement that led to the creation of COSATU, forming alliances with political parties and civil society, building institutions for tripartism and consultation with business and government, mass mobilisation and membership and finally, shaping economic policy. I find that most of COSATUs achievements resulted from the federation's ability to engage in and find the right balance between economic and political unionism and to engage in strategic unionism in either sphere. The federation's unique participatory and democratic shop steward system also facilitated worker militancy and cohesiveness.(cont.) The federation's unique participatory and democratic shop steward system also facilitated worker militancy and cohesiveness. The federation has failed and faces challenges to both membership and organisation because it has inadequately confronted the material conditions of capitalism which have resulted in structural issues such as the informalisation and casualisation of the work force. Political engagement has had costs for COSATU, the most significant of which have been the class mobility of unionists into government and the opportunism that comes with the possibility for class mobility. The union is also drawn into the internal politics of the ANC government and likewise has seen its own internal leadership battles affected by this relationship. The federation has also failed in being adequately strategic and independent in its relationship with the ANC and risks getting consumed and distracted from its strategic and tactical goals through cooptation by the ANC.",

        "Abstrak": "Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language ability that occurs secondary to brain damage, and auditory comprehension deficits are a defining component of aphasia. At the single-word level, these deficits are thought to arise from impaired phonological processing, semantic representations, or both. The present study examined spreading lexical activation in people with aphasia by implementing thorough clinical evaluation, a series of listening tasks, and a time sensitive means of tracking cortical activation. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to measure the cortical activity of 7 people with aphasia, 9 age-matched control participants, and 10 younger control participants as they completed an auditory lexical decision task and a passive listening task with phonemes. In the lexical decision task, target words were presented in three conditions of interest: semantically primed, where the target was preceded by a related word; identity primed, where the target was preceded by itself; and a control condition, where the target was preceded by an unrelated word. Behavioral reaction times and MEG data were collected in response to each target, and the M350, a MEG signal associated with lexical processing, was evaluated. MEG data collected during the passive listening task were used to evaluate the mismatch field (MMF), a response associated with the formation of an auditory memory trace. Analysis was conducted at both the group and single-subject levels.(cont.) All groups showed identity priming of the M350 response, although this was seen in the amplitude dimension for the control groups but in the latency dimension for the group with aphasia. The older control group showed semantic priming of the M350 and the younger group showed a marginally significant priming effect, while the group with aphasia failed to show this effect. There was evidence that some people with aphasia may have a delayed or absent M350 response. Finally, the behavioral results indicated that the younger and older control participants were using different strategies to complete the lexical decision task. These findings highlight the potential importance of latency differences when analyzing electrophysiological responses in aphasic populations. Furthermore, they indicate that some cognitive-linguistic tasks may induce different types of processing in older and younger groups.",

Sophisticated computational systems coupled with human-like form and function render such robots as potentially powerful forms of persuasive technology. Currently, there is very little understanding of the persuasive potential of such machines. As personal robots become a reality in our immediate environment, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind, and the capabilities of, their ability to influence, is becoming increasingly important. This thesis proposes some guiding principles by which to qualify persuasion. A study was designed in which the MDS (Mobile Dexterous Social) robotic platform was used to solicit visitors for donations at the Museum of Science in Boston. The study tests some nonverbal behavioral variables known to change persuasiveness in humans, and measures their effect in human-robot interaction. The results of this study indicate that factors such as robot-gender, subject-gender, touch, interpersonal distance, and the perceived autonomy of the robot, have a huge impact on the interaction between human and robot, and must be taken into consideration when designing sociable robots. This thesis applies the term persuasive robotics to define and test the theoretical and practical implications for robot-triggered changes in human attitude and behavior. Its results provide for a vast array of speculations with regard to what practical applications may become available using this framework.",

        "Abstrak": "Many ubiquitous computing scenarios are enabled by the ability to detect and identify objects in a user's environment, and recently Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been considered an affordable technology for providing such ability. However, RFID approaches have been flawed: when they operate at long range, they fail to provide adequate context as to which tagged objects are the subject of the user's interest; and when tuned for short range operation, they require the user to explicitly scan the tagged object. In addition, the knowledge gained from the user interacting with the object is limited to identification. This thesis proposes an ambient metaphor for detecting daily environments suitable for the upcoming far-field UHF RFID infrastructure. A user carries a mobile RFID reader, which creates a sphere of detection field to monitor RFID tags surrounding the user. The reader silently monitors the objects and functions as an agent that supports the user's consciousness of events happening outside of the user's attention. With sensor-enhanced RFID tags, our system does not limit itself to identification, but also provides the status of the corresponding item. The data from the sensors are used to distinguish a tag in a multiple tag environment and to describe the interactions between the user and the host object. This improves the selectivity and the context-awareness of the system.",

        "Abstrak": "The cells of metazoan organisms possess the capability to commit a form of cellular suicide known as programmed cell death or apoptosis. The proper control of this endogenous death program is essential to animal development and to the prevention of disease. To better understand how individual cells are developmentally specified to die, I studied the survival decision of a single cell type in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the CEM neurons. The CEMs die during hermaphrodite embryogenesis and survive and function as sensory neurons in males. I identified 144 independent mutant strains in which the CEM neurons of hermaphrodites survive, including 52 mutants in known cell-death genes and 67 mutants generally defective sex determination. Another 29 screen isolates displayed a new defect of transcriptional de repression, the green pharynx phenotype. From these isolates and from additional screens, I defined a set of seven genes that function to prevent inappropriate gene expression. From the isolates causing CEM survival I identified two new sex-determination proteins, the PLZF-like transcription factor TRA-4 and the F-box protein SEL-10; demonstrated that the neurogenesis genes vab-3 Pax6 and cnd-1 NeuroD are required for aspects of the CEM fate, including CEM death, and likely function together in this process and in other aspects of C. elegans development, a cooperative relationship likely to be evolutionarily conserved; and identified the Bar family homeodomain transcription factor gene ceh-30 as specifically promoting CEM survival. The CEM neurons of males lacking ceh-30 inappropriately undergo programmed cell death. In the CEMs of hermaphrodites, ceh-30 is directly repressed by TRA-1, a transcription factor that acts as the last step in the sex-determination pathway to promote a hermaphrodite identity.(cont.) The cell-protective function of ceh-30 is specific to the CEM neurons, and ceh-30 is expressed in and acts cell-autonomously in the CEMs to promote their survival. Expression of the mouse ceh-30 homolog Barhll can restore CEM survival to ceh-30 mutants. In mice lacking Barhl1, as in ceh-30 mutants, a specific class of sensory neuron is generated normally differentiates, but subsequently inappropriately undergoes apoptotic cell death. Protection of the CEM neurons by ceh-30 does not require CED-9, the sole member of the multidomain Bcl-2 family in C. elegans. By contrast, other regulators of the survival decisions of specific cells in C. elegans act through transcriptional control of the CED-9 inhibitor egl-1. Mammalian regulation of cell death is similarly almost entirely mediated through members of the multidomain Bcl-2 family. The evolutionarily conserved cell-protective function of ceh-30 therefore probably defines a previously unknown mechanism capable of promoting cell survival both in nematode development, in the sensory neurons required for hearing in the mouse and likely in humans.",

        "Abstrak": "The objective of this thesis is to investigate the applications of Time Reversed Acoustics (TRA) to locate seismic sources and image subsurface structures. The back-propagation process of the TRA experiment can be divided into the acausal and causal time domain. Studying the acausal process of TRA enables us to locate the source, such as an earthquake, inside a medium. The causal domain allows us to create a new datum through the TRA-based redatuming operators and then image the subsurface structures. The source location application directly uses the retro-focusing feature of the TRA technique. An earthquake is traditionally located using the arrival times of individual phases, such as P and S. As a supplementary tool, TRA provides an opportunity to locate earthquakes using whole waveforms. In this TRA technique, we first record the full seismograms due to an earthquake at an array of stations. The traces are then time-reversed and numerically sent back into the medium at those station locations using an a priori model of the medium. The wavefield of the back-propagation is tracked and in the end energy will concentrate at a focal spot which gives the original earthquake location. Both synthetic and field experiments show the capability of the TRA technique to locate the source. TRA, combined with the idea of empirical Green's function, also provides an alternative approach to quickly estimating the focal depth for shallow events. In several field studies, solutions from other independent methodologies confirm the validity of the results. The subsurface imaging application extends the TRA principle into a redatuming method, which allows us to image the target more effectively by bypassing the overburden - which could potentially be very complicated in certain situations - between the sources and receivers.(cont.) An accurate subsurface model required by conventional imaging techniques, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain, is no longer the prerequisite with this data-driven, TRA-based redatuming technique. Meanwhile, by imaging from a new datum that is closer to the target, the uncertainty of the imaging operator is dramatically reduced. The applicability of imaging the salt flank with the presence of a salt canopy is investigated in both acoustic and elastic scenarios with synthetic examples. Resulting images show very good delineation of the salt edge and dipping sediments abutting the salt dome. Then with the theoretical knowledge of the technique, we apply it to a 3D field experiment. In this complex field problem, with its challenge of the 3D geometry of the salt and acquisition, together with the limitation of the single well imaging, we propose a new directional imaging approach to implementing the TRA-based redatuming algorithm. The result is consistent with previous studies in this field, given the uncertainties on positioning of steep events from surface seismic data.",

        "Abstrak": "Aging is a universal process that occurs in eukaryotic organisms. Many features of aging, including the genetic pathways involved in aging, appear to be evolutionarily conserved. Extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) have been identified to be a cause of replicative aging in budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Genomic instability can cause ERCs to excise from chromosomal rDNA arrays, containing 35S and 5S rRNA genes. At each cell division, ERCs replicate via an origin of replication present in each rDNA repeat, accumulate asymmetrically in the mother cells due to their segregation bias, and ultimately cause nucleolar fragmentation and senescence. Introduction of an ERC into young cells shortens life span and accelerates the onset of age-associated sterility. ERCs are excised from the rDNA locus by homologous recombination. rad52 mutant cells, defective in DNA repair through homologous recombination, do not accumulate ERCs with age; likewise, mutations in other genes of the RAD52 class that have varying effects on homologous recombination have corresponding effects on ERC formation. rad52 mutation leads to a progressive delocalization of a silencing and DNA repair protein Sir3p from telomeres to other nuclear sites with age and, surprisingly, shortens life span despite the absence of ERCs. Spontaneous DNA damage, perhaps double-strand breaks (DSBs), are likely the cause of lethality in mutants of the RAD52 class and may be an initial step in aging in wild-type cells. Replication fork pausing in E. coli can cause DSBs. Consistently, afobl mutation, which abolishes unidirectional replication fork barrier (RFB) at the rDNA, reduces rDNA recombination, decreases ERC accumulation with age, and thus extends life span.(cont.) Therefore, reduction of ERC formation infobl cells is likely the consequence of an absence of DSBs caused by replication fork pausing at RFB, again suggesting that DSBs are the initial step in yeast aging. Foblp is also required for transcription enhancement from an ectopic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoter outside of the rDNA, but not at rDNA. The role of Foblp in this enhancement may be to facilitate interactions between rDNA repeats and the ectopic promoter, thus allowing recruitment of Pol I transcriptional machinery to the ectopic promoter. Consistent with this notion, Foblp influences the structural dynamics at rDNA. Foblp antagonizes Sir2p-dependent rDNA silencing and thus affects rDNA chromatin structure. fobl mutation partially suppresses the aberrant rDNA structure in topoisomerase I-deficient (topl) cells, likely by relieving torsional stress created during rDNA replication. In addition, afobl mutation was able to rescue the synthetic lethality in topl trf4 double mutant cells, due to the failure of mitotic condensation at rDNA. fobl mutation complemented several defects caused by trf4 mutation, suggesting that Trf4p, DNA polymerase [sigma], may have a specialized function at rDNA. FOB1 and likely RFB may play a direct role in the macromolecular rDNA structure that influences chromosome transmission and indirectly affects aging in yeast.",

        "Abstrak": "The process of programmed cell death is important in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. The conserved morphological events of this process have been termed apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of apoptosis execution are also conserved. We have investigated the behavior of these shared components during programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have found that the CED-9 protein, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators, is required for the sequestering of the CED-4 cell-death activator to mitochondria. In the absence of CED-9 in C. elegans embryos, we found that CED-4 protein translocates to the nuclear membrane. In addition, inducing excess programmed cell death by expression of the EGL-1 cell-death activator triggers the translocation of CED-4 from mitochondria to the nuclear membrane. We performed a genetic screen for mutations that trigger programmed cell death in ced-9 gain-of-function animals where cell death is blocked. We identified a mutation in cup-5, the C. elegans homolog of the human mucolipidosis type IV gene, which is mutated in a lysosomal storage disorder. We found that cup-5 is required for viability and that excess lysosomes accumulate in cup-5 mutants. In addition, cup--5 mutants contain excess programmed cell deaths, suggesting that apoptosis may play a role in the pathology of mucolipidosis type IV.",

        "Abstrak": "In this study, the feasibility and utility of using a maneuverable nanosatellite laser guide star from a geostationary equatorial orbit have been assessed to enable ground-based, adaptive optics imaging of geosynchronous satellites with next-generation extremely large telescopes. The concept for a satellite guide star was first discussed in the literature by Greenaway and Clark in the early 1990s (\"PHAROS: An Agile Satellite-Borne Laser Guidestar,\" Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 2120, 1994, pp. 206-210), and expanded upon by Albert in 2012 (\"Satellite-Mounted Light Sources as Photometric Calibration Standards for Ground-Based Telescopes,\" Astronomical Journal, Vol. 143, No. 1, 2012, p. 8). With a satellite-based laser as an adaptive optics guide star, the source laser does not need to scatter, and is well above atmospheric turbulence. When viewed from the ground through a turbulent atmosphere, the angular size of the satellite guide star is much smaller than a backscattered source. Advances in small-satellite technology and capability allowed the revisiting of the concept on a 6U CubeSat, measuring 10×20×30 cm. It is shown that a system that uses a satellite-based laser transmitter can be relatively low power (~1 W transmit power) and operated intermittently. Although the preliminary analysis indicates that a single satellite guide star cannot be used for observing multiple astronomical targets, it will only require a little propellant to relocate within the geosynchronous belt. Results of a design study on the feasibility of a small-satellite guide star have been presented, and the potential benefits to astronomical imaging and to the larger space situational awareness community have been highlighted.",

At low applied tensions, the knot traverses the chain diffusively, while at higher tensions the knot makes slow, discrete hops that can be described as a Poisson process. In this “jammed” regime, the knot’s long-time diffusivity decreases exponentially with increasing tension. We quantify how these measurements are altered by chain rigidity and the corrugation of the polymer backbone. We also characterize the energy barrier of the reptation moves that gives rise to the knot’s motion. For the simple knot types examined thus far (3[subscript 1], 4[subscript 1], 5[subscript 1], 5[subscript 2]), the dominant contribution to the energy landscape appears in the first step of reptation—i.e., polymer entering the knotted core. We hope this study gives insight into what physics contributes to the internal friction of highly jammed knots.",

        "Abstrak": "Issues of robust stability and performance have dominated the field of systems and control theory because of their practical importance. The recently developed Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) based analysis method provides a framework for systematically checking robustness properties of large complex dynamical systems. In IQC analysis, the system to be analyzed is represented as a nominal, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) subsystem interconnected with a perturbation term. The perturbation is characterized in terms of IQCs. The robustness condition is expressed as a feasibility problem which can be solved using interiorpoint algorithms. Although the systems to be analyzed have nominal LTI subsystems in many applications, this is not always the case. A typical example is the problem of robustness analysis of the oscillatory behavior of nonlinear systems, where the nominal subsystem is generally Linear Periodically Time-Varying (LPTV). The objective of the first part of this thesis is to develop new techniques for robustness analysis of LPTV systems. Two different approaches are proposed. In the first approach, the harmonic terms of the LPTV nominal model are extracted, and the system is transformed into the standard setup for robustness analysis. Robustness analysis is then performed on the transformed system based on the IQC analysis method. In the second approach, we allow the nominal system to remain periodic, and we extend the IQC analysis method to include the case where the nominal system is periodically time-varying.(cont.) The robustness condition of this new approach is posed as semi-infinite convex feasibility problems which requires a new method to solve. A computational algorithm is developed for checking the robustness condition.In the second part of the thesis, we consider the optimization problems arising from IQC analysis. The conventional way of solving these problems is to transform them into semi-definite programs which are then solved using interior-point algorithms. The disadvantage of this approach is that the transformation introduces additional decision variables. In many situations, these auxiliary decision variables become the main computational burden, and the conventional method then becomes very inefficient and time consuming. In the second part of the thesis, a number of specialized algorithms are developed to solve these problems in a more efficient fashion. The crucial advantage in this development is that it avoids the equivalent transformation. The results of numerical experiments confirm that these algorithms can solve a problem arising from IQC analysis much faster than the conventional approach does.",

This three-part thesis presents research directed towards understanding these anomalies and searching for sterile neutrino oscillations. Part I contains a theoretical discussion of neutrino coherence properties. The open-quantum-system picture of neutrino beams, which allows a rigorous prediction of coherence distances for accelerator neutrinos, is presented. Validity of the standard treatment of active and sterile neutrino oscillations at short baselines is verified and non-standard coherence loss effects at longer baselines are predicted. Part II concerns liquid argon detector development for the MicroBooNE experiment, which will search for short-baseline oscillations in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab. Topics include characterization and installation of the MicroBooNE optical system; test-stand measurements of liquid argon optical properties with dissolved impurities; optimization of wavelength-shifting coatings for liquid argon scintillation light detection; testing and deployment of high-voltage surge arrestors to protect TPC field cages; and software development for optical and TPC simulation and reconstruction. Part III presents a search for sterile neutrinos using the IceCube neutrino telescope, which has collected a large sample of atmospheric-neutrino-induced events in the 1-10 TeV energy range. Sterile neutrinos would modify the detected neutrino flux shape via MSW-resonant oscillations. Following a careful treatment of systematic uncertainties in the sample, no evidence for MSW-resonant oscillations is observed, and exclusion limits on 3+1 model parameter space are derived. Under the mixing assumptions made, the 90% confidence level exclusion limit extends to ... , and the LSND and MiniBooNE allowed regions are excluded at >99% confidence level.",

        "Abstrak": "Smoothness is characteristic of coordinated human movements, and stroke patients' movements seem to grow more smooth with recovery. A robotic therapy device was used to analyze five different measures of movement smoothness in the hemiparetic arm of thirty-one patients recovering from stroke. Four of the five metrics showed general increases in smoothness for the entire patient population. However according to the fifth metric, the movements of patients with recent stroke grew less smooth over the course of therapy. This pattern was reproduced in a computer simulation of recovery based on submovement blending, suggesting that progressive blending of submovements underlies stroke recovery. Submovements are hypothesized fundamental building blocks of human movement. All available evidence is consistent with their existence and no other theory has been proposed that can fully account for observed phenomena in human movement. However, there is no obvious way to prove their existence. Nevertheless, repeatedly successful decomposition of movement data into submovements may produce sufficient evidence to make the question moot. The component submovements of stroke patients' point-to-point movements were estimated using a novel submovement extraction algorithm. Over the course of therapy, patients' submovements tended to increase in peak speed and duration.(cont.) The number of submovements employed to produce a given movement decreased. The time between the peaks of adjacent submovements decreased for inpatients (those less than 1 month post-stroke), but not for outpatients (those greater than 12 months post-stroke) as a group. Submovements became more overlapped for all patients, but more markedly for inpatients. This pattern of changes in the extracted submovement parameters 1) provides an objective basis for evaluating patients' state of motor recovery and 2) provides some degree of additional support for the existence of submovements.",

        "Abstrak": "Most of the information in this proposal is derived from my former and current research on Beirut, Methodology for Slow Conservation of War-Damaged Structures in Downtown Beirut. In the earlier version I have failed to highlight the significance of the Martyrs Square area. My aim in this addendum is to shed more light on the above. By doing so the conservation/rehabilitation zone takes on more of an inclusive and representational character, reflective of the richness and variety inherent in Beirut's complex urban fabric. An intriguing aspect of this study is the rather remote chance for implementing any such reconstructive schemes. Given the recent rounds of fighting, it has become more hopeless to conceive of any notion of conservation or rehabilitation. A positive aspect, however, may be derived from the existing schemes already drafted during this decade, for the area's possible rehabilitation/conservation. The recent decree for the opeirlng of \"Greater Beirut\" by President Elias Hrawi sheds more optimism. It is with the hope that some day soon the Lebanese conscience and that of the world will prevail so that humanity and people may live, enjoy, produce, thrive and flourish more abundantly - that history proves, as it has done in the past, that destruction can be overcome. Only then, we could possibly talk about more than surveys and protective measures to safeguard our historic heritage. This will be the time to restore and rehabilitate the New Martyrs Square in memory of those who died in the late Civil War. The second part of the thesis expands the scope of the subject to include the Shouf region. It is here that the roots for regional Lebanese architecture are inherent. While fighting and bombing have also shattered a considerable number of significant structures in this area; the process of reconstruction and occasional restoration has proven more effective than in urban Beirut. The process was carried over on the initiative of individuals. The primary reasons for such immediate intervention on the part of individuals was the advantage of less constraints in terms of the absence of bureaucracies (even with dramatically less fundamental support) and needless to say the lack of written conservation more comprehensive strategy for the area. Instead, alternate examples of almost identical character and plan will be substituted. legislation; these ,together boosted the rehabilitation/restoration process. A great many historical edifices and even more modest structures have already been fully restored, while the bulk of Beirut's historical structures and quarters are decaying with time and neglect. An equally important aspect in this scenario is the nature of the occupants and their attitudes toward preservation. While mountain dwellers seem more attached to their land and homestead, and accordingly are very reluctant to leave their surroundings, the city dwellers are more prone to mobility and social change. This aspect resulted in more restoration efforts in the mountains and accordingly less such in Beirut. Moreover, the building type most affected by destruction in Beirut happens to be concentrated in the heart of the city, Le.; the central business district, where hardly any residential apartment buildings exist. People seem to be more attached to their primary and more immediate surroundings, such as their own houses, which makes them more inclined by force-majeur to restore their dwellings. The last part of this thesis attempts to propose some particular \"bylaws\" or \"clauses\" regarding appropriate intervention. Consideration will be given to adaptive - reuse issues; especially as to what extent significant structures can be adaptively reused according to local conventions. No written bylaws exist in this sphere and the only precedent seems to encompass civil and religious buildings; this renders such an issue extremely delicate, if not controversial. This also leads us to one other major question -- to what extent should legislation permit physical alteration of historical structures? Finally, an integral element in this thesis is the lack of conservation legislation in third world countries in general of which Lebanon is only one example; and how could legislation and local conventions be more effective through implementation in wider parts of the Middle East region, especially after the war. ·On the whole, this thesis attempts to raise questions, suggest certain possible solutions to given problems, provide a status quo report from 1982 to the present, and family draw conclusions. The conclusions are by no means rigid and therefore remain subject to debate and further questioning.",

        "Abstrak": "In Washington D.C., as in many other American cities, a significant section of the downtown is distinguished by boarded-up buildings and vacant lots. In spite of traces of a city plan that could organize and accommodate a variety of activities in the central core, downtown Washington is under used. The eastern section of the downtown, where the majority of decrepit buildings and vacant lots are located, is inhabited primarily by office-workers on weekdays and a small number of tourists on weekends. After working hours the area is virtually devoid of people. Currently there is very little housing downtown. Recently, however, three large mixed-use residential buildings have been constructed in the eastern portion of the downtown. These projects were developed by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (Pfc) as part of a comprehensive plan for the economic and physical revitalization of Pennsylvania Avenue and its environs. The popular success of these buildings shows that people in Washington are interested in living downtown. It is the premise of this thesis that introducing residential use to the downtown would improve the liveliness of the area which I believe is important for the future vitality of the city. But how should residential use be introduced to this area where large block-sized office buildings and federal institutions have transformed the previous pattern of blocks made up of smaller buildings and cut by alleys to admit light and access? The sizes and orientation appropriate for residential use are different from those suitable for commercial and institutional use . A problem with the PADC's approach to developing a residential presence downtown is that the blocks and building masses are treated in much the same way for residences as they are for commercial and institutional buildings. To include residential use in the commercial, monumental sector of the city requires a street and block pattern that can be adapted to accommodate large and small buildings. This pattern can be deployed to establish a finer-grained network of residential use within the structure of the commercial, monumental city. The result of this pattern would be an identifiable residential area supporting the physical and social needs of the residents.",

We all share memory and experience with urban infrastructure, e.g. we drive on the same roads and park our cars in the same parking garage every day. Urban infrastructure are not important or great places for us because they are designed by non-human factors, but by requirement of cars. One can question why we need to make urban infrastructure to become a better place? The answer is that urban infrastructure often occupies important geographical location in the cities for distribution of cars, human, water and energy. In a dense urban environment, the high land value makes the creation of non-commercial buildings and places, such as religion, cemetery, playground and parks, being enormous difficult. These activities can only occupy less prominent locations in cities. In addition, public programs nowadays is mostly tied with consumption of goods, services and cultural activities. If urban infrastructure is one of the necessities in center of urban environment and lack enough human consideration while we all share experience with them, can we take this situation as an opportunity to redefine the role of urban infrastructure. Can urban infrastructure be a civic building? This thesis aims at resolving the dilemma that non-commercial driven public programs are difficult to exist in high density urban environment because of high land price. This thesis proposes hybridizing parking garage with non-commercial public programs. The transformation to suit the need of human need and technical requirement provides new opportunities for searching didactic forms and sublime techniques. Also, if the purpose of building more roads and highway is to speed up the time of moving around the city, the parking garage is a place where cars stop. This thesis propose to use parking garage to slow down people's life in the city. It is a place where people can take a rest from the network of driving and escape from our busy city life.",

The mono-functional spread of industrial estate has a limited life span, it is vulnerable to economic downturn, and undermine the possibility of small scale farming, an economic practice that is proved still relevant given the fact that rural and urban citizenship still maintain a clear distinction. This thesis proposes a new model of industrial facility that addresses the conflict of rural land resources rapid industrialization. It provides the necessary infrastructure for a constantly changing rural urban economic model. It is invested in creating an urbanity out of this unique economy without necessarily abiding to the conventional zoning model.

The work stems from an attraction to the messy vitality we find in certain environments (such as back alleys), and searches for an understanding of the relationship that exists between the chaos and the underlying order. Chaos is defined and defended, as a crucial component of our lives in social and urbanistic terms. A parallel interest is revealed in a review of particular 20th century art. Modern housing approaches are critiqued in terms of an order/chaos relationship, and compared to non-western and vernacular precedents. A historic mill site is analyzed, considered for its transformational qualities and housing potential. Formal explorations and a design proposal address issues of housing for transformation in the existing mill buildings and in a new support structure.

We also design polynomial-time algorithms achieving near-optimal approximation guarantees with respect to the adaptive optimum. Finally, we prove complexity-theoretic results regarding optimal adaptive policies. These results are based on a connection between adaptive policies and Arthur-Merlin games which yields PSPACE-hardness results for numerous questions regarding adaptive policies.In this thesis we study a variety of combinatorial problems with inherent randomness. In the first part of the thesis, we study the possibility of covering the solutions of an optimization problem on random subgraphs. The motivation for this approach is a situation where an optimization problem needs to be solved repeatedly for random instances. Then we seek a pre-processing stage which would speed-up subsequent queries by finding a fixed sparse subgraph covering the solution for a random subgraph with high probability. The first problem that we investigate is the minimum spanning tree. Our essential result regarding this problem is that for every graph with edge weights, there is a set of O(n log n) edges which contains the minimum spanning tree of a random subgraph with high probability. More generally, we extend this result to matroids. Further, we consider optimization problems based on the shortest path metric and we find covering sets of size 0(n(Ì‚1+2/c) log2Ì‚ n) that approximate the shortest path metric of a random vertex-induced subgraph within a constant factor of c with high probability. In the second part, we turn to a model of stochastic optimization, where a solution is built sequentially by selecting a collection of \"items\". We distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies, where adaptivity means being able to perceive the precise characteristics of chosen items and use this knowledge in subsequent decisions. The benefit of adaptivity is our central concept which we investigate for a variety of specific problems. For the Stochastic Knapsack problem, we prove constant upper and lower bounds on the \"adaptivity gap\" between optimal adaptive and non-adaptive policies. For more general Stochastic",

Now, let C be a curve of genus 2 over a field k of positive characteristic, and V₂ the Verschiebung rational map induced by pullback under Frobenius on moduli spaces of semistable vector bundles of rank two and trivial determinant. We show that if the Frobenius-unstable vector bundles are deformation-free in a suitable sense, then they are precisely the undefined points of V₂, and may each be resolved by a single blow-up; in this setting, we are able to calculate the degree of V₂ in terms of the number of Frobenius-unstable bundles, and describe the image of the exceptional divisors.

The project aims to operate within the context of the ongoing debate between the private corporation and its relationship with the public realm (including the commodification of natural resources). The background to this project is rooted locally in the early urbanization of this region at the hands of corporations such as U.S Steel, but also historically through an examination of the various positions taken by architects throughout the 20th century in regards to the notion of industrial production. This thesis accepts the plurality of this site and the perceived role of the architect in the industrial sector as given and therefore suggests an architecture that operates as a staging ground for the seemingly conflicting interests of the private corporation and those of the public realm. In this sense, the architecture of the factory must operate strictly within a given PROGRAM that maximizes the efficiency and profit of the corporate client (think Albert Kahn), but it must also act as a mitigator to the challenge presented by a reluctant public, in essence calling for the architecture of the factory to become a symbol of something else entirely, or the ANTI-PROGRAM (think Gropius, LeCorbusier, Mendelsohn). In terms of the lakefront BP site, my project hypothesizes that as oil becomes a less profitable product, companies such as BP will shift their business interests accordingly. Specifically, my project proposes that BP transforms itself from an oil company to a water company. As BP begins bottling water from Lake Michigan and selling it around the world for great profit, they will be sure to spin their new business as an environmentally responsible one, surely noting to the public that they are now financially invested in keeping the Lake clean and free of pollution.(cont.) But such a shift in business will positively stir the debate with the local municipalities that get their water from the Lake and also the environmentalists that cast the bottled-water industry in a similar dark light as the oil companies of today. Therefore, my thesis project will operate within the framework of this debate, employing methods of landscape intervention but also new architecture for a new product (BP water).",

        "Abstrak": "We present an extensible-link kinematic model for characterizing the motion trajectory of an arbitrary planar compliant mechanism. This is accomplished by creating an analogous kinematic model consisting of links that change length over the course of actuation to represent elastic deformation of the compliant mechanism. Within the model, the motion trajectory is represented as an analytical function. By Taylor series expansion, the trajectory is expressed in a parametric formulation composed of load-independent and load-dependent terms. Here, the load-independent terms are entirely defined by the shape of the undeformed compliant mechanism topology, and all load-geometry interdependencies are captured by the load-dependent terms. This formulation adds insight to the process for designing compliant mechanisms for high accuracy motion applications because: (1) inspection of the load-independent terms enables determination of specific topology modifications for improving the accuracy of the motion trajectory; and (2) the load-dependent terms reveal the polynomial orders of principally uncorrectable error components of the motion trajectory. The error components in the trajectory simply represent the deviation of the actual motion trajectory provided by the compliant mechanism compared to the ideally desired one. We develop the generalized model framework, and then demonstrate its utility by designing a compliant micro-gripper with straight-line parallel jaw motion. We use the model to analytically determine all topology modifications for optimizing the jaw trajectory, and to predict the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory components. The jaw trajectory is then optimized by iterative finite elements (FE) simulation until the polynomial order of the uncorrectable trajectory component becomes apparent.",

The new design presented in this thesis resolves these issues while making the arm more user-friendly and inexpensive enough for classroom use. It uses Hitec HS-805BB hobby servo motors to directly drive each joint. Controlling these motors is effortless with the many commercially available servo motor drivers. Modular construction allows students to change the shape and size of the arm's workspace easily; creating and installing custom linkages is a simple task. Linkages and motor output shafts mount to a common connection shaft with one-sided cut hubs. The radial loads in these shafts are supported by maintenance-free Super Oilite bronze bearings. This robotic arm is better suited for a classroom environment than the current one. It weighs 2.7 pounds; the old one weight 21.2 pounds. Though its workspace and recommended linkage length are about 7% smaller than those of the old design are, it is 87% more precise.(cont.) It is 60% cheaper with a materials cost of $120 for a two degree of freedom arm. The new motors have 343 oz-in of torque, which is sufficient to handle a 12 oz payload 17 inches from the joint axis or a 16 oz payload at 14 inches. Students will spend less time connecting wires and calibrating sensors. This arm should be a welcome addition to the introductory robotics classroom.",

The notion of a Lagrangian covering can be used to extend the method of polarizing a nilpotent coadjoint orbit to obtain a unitary representation of G. W. Graham and D. Vogan propose such a construction, relying on the notions of orbital varieties and admissible orbit data. The first part of the thesis seeks to understand the set of orbital varieties contained in a given nipotent orbit. Starting from N. Spaltenstein's parameterization of the irreducible components of the variety of flags fixed by a unipotent, we produce a parameterization of the orbital varieties lying in the corresponding fiber of the Steinberg map. The parameter set is the family of standard Young or domino tableau of a given shape. The key to the proof is understanding certain closed cycles as defined by D. Garfinkle. This parameterization is particularly useful; it provides a method of determining the r-invariant of each orbital variety, as well as a way of relating an orbital variety in any classical group to one lying in type A.(cont.) The second part of the thesis addresses the representations V(V, ir) constructed by Graham and Vogan. A natural question is how well the V(V, 7r) approximate the set of unipotent representations that ought to be attached to the nilpotent orbit 0. The answer is promising in the setting of spherical orbits. When it is possible to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction, the corresponding infinitesimal character lies in the set of characters suggested by W. M. McGovern. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for a suffient number of orbital varieties to account for all the infinitesimal characters attached to 0 by McGovern.",

        "Abstrak": "California City is a superlative shrinking suburb. Situated deep in the Mojave Desert, the conditions that typically spur suburban shrinkage are exaggerated here. As such, the city provides a singular opportunity to comment on the decline of the road-centric, single family house dominated town typology within a specific context. This thesis examines the decaying suburban condition and proposes an architectural intervention that embraces a city's collapse as analogous to death and imagines a reincarnated future. It addresses the notion that shrinkage must be either reversed or ameliorated and instead proposes that it be amplified and radicalized. The architectural proposal is activated at two scales: that of the landscape (or kaboodle) and that of the individual belonging (or kipple). As the town grapples with death on a suburban scale, it encounters deeply personal questions as an entire community. What does it mean when a city dies? How do those who must remain grieve, come to terms with their loss, and move on? What becomes of the corpse? The stuff of the suburb is examined in depth as the psyche of California City and given architectural agency as the means by which the town is destroyed, reconstituted and rebirthed anew. As it is abandoned, salvaged, catalogued, and transformed, this suburban discharge slowly transforms the reincarnated city into an archival catalog of a previous being: an enclavic representation of what was lost.",

        "Abstrak": "The increase in air temperature observed in urban environments compared to the undeveloped rural surroundings, known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, is being intensely studied, due to its adverse environmental and economic impacts. Some of the causes of the UHI effect are related to the interactions between buildings and the urban environment. This thesis presents a methodology intended to integrate building energy and urban climate studies for the first time. It is based on the premise that at the same time buildings are affected by their urban environment, the urban climate is affected by the energy performance of buildings. To predict this reciprocal interaction, the developed methodology couples a detailed building simulation program, EnergyPlus, with a physically based urban canopy model, the Town Energy Balance (TEB). Both modeling tools are leading their respective fields of study. The Urban Weather Generator (UWG) methodology presented in this thesis is a transformation of meteorological information from a weather station located in an open area to a particular urban location. The UWG methodology fulfils two important needs. First, it is able to simulate the energy performance of buildings taking into account site-specific urban weather conditions. Second, it proposes a building parameterization for urban canopy models that takes advantage of the modelling experience of a state-of-the-art building simulation program. This thesis also presents the application of the UWG methodology to a new urban area, Masdar (Abu Dhabi). The UHI effect produced in this hot and arid climate by an urban canyon configuration and its impact on the energy performance of buildings are analyzed.",

While microfabrication technology processes can create electronic devices in vast quantities with increasingly smaller dimensions, they are challenged to do so for mechanical devices at low cost and in large quantity. More traditional manufacturing processes such as machining or injection molding can more easily meet cost and quantity requirements, but are unable to currently match the dimensional abilities of microfabrication processes. By merging microfabrication and traditional injection molding techniques, the benefits of both technologies can be combined to produce parts to meet all three requirements. The objective of this research is to investigate the possibilities of injection molding polymer parts with sub-micron three-dimensional features using a process called Silicon Insert Molded Plastics (SIMP).",

        "Abstrak": "The United States Navy has recognized the rising age of its nuclear reactors. With this increasing age comes increasing importance of backup generators. In addition to the need for decay heat removal common to all (naval and commercial) nuclear reactors, naval vessels with nuclear reactors also require a backup means of propulsion. All underway Navy nuclear reactors are operated with diesel generators as a backup power system, able to provide emergency electric power for reactor decay heat removal as well as enough electric power to supply an emergency propulsion mechanism. While all commercial nuclear reactors are required to incorporate multiple backup generators, naval submarine nuclear plants feature a single backup generator. The increasing age of naval nuclear reactors, coupled with the dual requirements of a submarine's solitary backup generator, makes the study of submarine backup generators vital. This thesis examines more than 7,000 maintenance records dated 1989 to 2005 for emergency diesel generator engines onboard Los Angeles class nuclear submarines. This class of submarines, which features the Fairbanks Morse 8-cylinder air-started opposed-piston diesel engine, is expected to continue to operate until at least 2020.(cont.) An analysis of corrective and routine maintenance tasks was conducted. Analysis included the diesel engine as well as its subsystems of diesel lube oil, diesel freshwater, diesel seawater, diesel air start, and diesel fuel oil. The analysis centered on maintenance task times and costs. Time factors analyzed included the time between maintenance actions, the time awaiting parts, the time to conduct the maintenance, and the impacts on operational availability. Cost factors analyzed included the material costs and the manpower costs (both sailors and off-hull workers). As patterns were recognized, high impact items were highlighted and recommendations to reduce risk to operational availability were given.",

Additionally, the NILM can use its electrical measurements to diagnose impending failures in the mechanical systems that are actuated by the electric loads. Ongoing NILM research conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (LEES) is exploring the application of NILM technology in shipboard environments. For the current shipboard applications, diagnostic software development is in progress. To aid in that process, research was done to understand the dynamics of a shipboard cycling system. This thesis presents an in-depth examination of the development of diagnostic indicators for a shipboard vacuum assisted waste disposal system. Measurements and experimentation were conducted onboard USCGC SENECA (WMEC-906), a 270-foot Coast Guard Cutter. In order to better understand the system dynamics, a computer based model was developed to simulate the system.(cont.) The intent of creating an in-depth model was to develop diagnostic methods that are applicable to any shipboard cycling systems. First, a base model is designed followed by the exploration of a realistic model that includes variation commonly found in the system. Thirdly, a diagnostics section explores methods to detect increased pump operation and distinguish between high system usage and the presence of a leak. Lastly, a basic cost analysis is done on the sewage system to show the benefits of installing a NILM.",

Nevertheless, its predictions are in very good agreement with the experimental results. In the calculations that Bruno and Vaynblat did to match their model against experiments, they simplified the dynamics - replacing rarefaction waves by \"rarefaction discontinuities\". In this thesis we implement the Bruno-Vaynblat model without any such simplifications. In the process of doing this, a new numerical method for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with phase transitions is developed. Furthermore, in order to improve the quantitative agreement with experiments, several extensions of the Bruno-Vaynblat model are introduced and studied. These include the addition of dissipative effects, and the introduction of a modification to the equation of state (for the Austenite phase) near the critical transition pressure.",

        "Abstrak": "Matched-field methods concern estimation of source location and/or ocean environmental parameters by exploiting full wave modeling of acoustic waveguide propagation. Typical estimation performance demonstrates two fundamental limitations. first, sidelobe ambiguities dominate the estimation at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to a threshold performance behavior. Second, most matched-field algorithms show a strong sensitivity to environmental/system mismatch, introducing some biased estimates at high SNR. In this thesis, a quantitative approach for ambiguity analysis is developed so that different mainlobe and sidelobe error contributions can be compared at different SNR levels. Two large-error performance bounds, the Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB) and Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB), are derived for the attainable accuracy of matched-field methods. To include mismatch effects, a modified version of the ZZB is proposed. Performance analyses are implemented for source localization under a typical shallow water environment chosen from the Shallow Water Evaluation Cell Experiments (SWellEX). The performance predictions describe the simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) well, including the mean square error in all SNR regions as well as the bias at high SNR. The threshold SNR and bias predictions are also verified by the SWellEX experimental data processing. These developments provide tools to better understand some fundamental behaviors in matched-field performance and provide benchmarks to which various ad hoc algorithms can be compared.",

A unified model for 3-D object scattering and reverberation that takes into account the coupling between propagation and scattering in a stratified medium is developed from wave theory. The conditions necessary for scattering in a waveguide to become diffuse is derived directly from Green's Theorem. Simulations with the unified model indicate that the detection of submerged target echoes above diffuse seafloor reverberation is highly dependent upon waveguide properties, bandwidth, array aperture, measurement geometry, and the scattering properties of the target. Analysis with the unified model shows that it is theoretically plausible for coherent returns from the scattering of evanescent waves by extended but discrete sub-bottom geologic features to stand significantly above diffuse or incoherent returns arising from small-scale roughness of the waveguide boundaries. A long-range bistatic sonar system was deployed in a field experiment and used to image extensive networks of buried river channels and inclined sub-seafloor strata over tens of kilometers in nearreal time. Such a capability is of great advantage in geophysical applications. Since buried river channels are expected to be ubiquitous in continental shelf environments, sub-seafloor geomorphology will play a major role in producing \"false alarms\" or cluster in long-range sonar systems that search for submerged objects such as underwater vehicles.(cont.) A generalized extinction theorem for object scattering in a stratified medium is derived that can be applied to detect and classify objects from the total field in the forward scatter direction in a waveguide. Analytic expressions are derived for the attenuation and dispersion in the forward propagated field due to scattering from random surface and volume inhomogeneities in a waveguide. The unified model is applied to show that the active sonar equation is not in general valid for scattering in a waveguide. It is shown that the sonar equation may be made approximately valid in a waveguide by lowering the active frequency of operation sufficiently for the given measurement scenario to simplify analysis for target classification and localization.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is a collection of essays on organizational economics and finance-related topics. Firms and individuals who sell opinions may bias their reports for either behavioral or strategic reasons. Chapter 1 proposes a new methodology for measuring these biases, particularly whether opinion producers under or over emphasize their private information, i.e. whether they herd or exaggerate their differences with the consensus. Applying the methodology to I/B/E/S analysts reveals that they do not herd as is often assumed, but rather they exaggerate their differences with the consensus by an average factor of about 2.4. Analysts also overweight their prior-period private information and thus under-update based on last period's forecast error; this under-updating helps explain the apparently conflicting over and under-reaction results of DeBondt and Thaler (1990) and Abarbanell and Bernhard (1992). A useful by-product of the methodology is a measure of the incremental information content of an analyst's forecasts. Using this measure reveals that analysts differ greatly in performance: the information content of the future forecasts of the top 10 percent of analysts is roughly six times that of the bottom 40 percent.(cont.) Chapter 2 examines whether career concerns can create an incentive for opinion-producing agents to exaggerate. We find that they can, the reason being that high-ability agents have opinions that are more different from the consensus on average and potential clients will learn more quickly about how different an agent's opinions are from the consensus on average that about whether or not they are exaggerating. The model predicts that agents should exaggerate more when they are under-rated by their clients, when the realizations of the variables they are forecasting are expected to be especially noisy, and when they expect to make fewer future forecasts. We find that these predictions are consistent with the empirical data on equity analyst's earnings forecasts. In models by Fershtman and Judd (1987) and Sklivas (1987), firms competing in quantities benefit strategically from commiting to managerial incentives that are biased toward revenue maximization. Little empirical evidence has been produced in support of these models, and their assumption that incentive contracts are observable has been criticized as unrealistic. Chapter 3 proposes an alternative model in which firms competing in strategic substitutes commit to using less precise profit measures, which biases the optimal unobservable contract towards revenue maximization. This model performs better empirically. Firms that compete in strategic substitutes choose less precise profit measures across six different measures, and firms with less precise profit measures in turn have stock returns and thus managerial incentives that are driven ...",

        "Abstrak": "These essays are concerned with the problem of cooperation among individuals in a household and among households in a community under lack of commitment. The first chapter provides a theoretical investigation of consumption patterns in a household in which income is stochastic and some expenditures are public to household members. It is shown that in the constrained efficient agreement, private expenditures of household members do not necessarily co-move, as they do in both the first-best agreement and the constrained efficient agreement when all expenditures are private. In particular, the absence of co-movement of private expenditures in the household do not necessarily imply the absence of mutual insurance; and, indeed, negative correlation in private expenditures can be consistent with a cooperative agreement. These results indicate that caution should be used in interpreting the correlation of private expenditures of household members as a measure of cooperation and mutual insurance within the household. Chapter two investigates the effect of lack of commitment on household savings in a constrained efficient mutual insurance agreement among different households.(cont.) It is shown that a saving rule is part of the agreement if and only if risk aversion changes with wealth. If not, no gains can be had from contracting on savings. Under reasonable assumptions about risk preferences, the constrained efficient agreement tends to depress savings to a greater extent for poorer individuals than for richer individuals, thus increasing inequality in consumption and wealth over time relative to the case where savings are not contracted. Chapter three (co-authored with Harounan Kazianga) provides evidence, using a survey of agricultural households in Burkina Faso, that plots owned by the head of the household is farmed much more intensively than plots, with similar characteristics and planted to the same crops, owned by other household members (of both genders). As in previous studies, this evidence is inconsistent with the assumption of Pareto efficiency in household decisions, but additionally suggests that status within the household rather than gender per se may be the most important factor in determining the allocation of productive resources within the household. We argue that the higher yields achieved by the household head may be explained in terms of social norms that require him to spend the earnings from some farms under his control exclusively on household public goods, as has been observed in the anthropological literature on this region.",

        "Abstrak": "I investigate search models in which firms wish to employ multiple workers. I first focus on efficiency. One important approach to modeling frictional labor markets is competitive search equilibrium, in which workers direct their search towards wages that firms commit to pay them upon hire. If each firm wishes to hire precisely one worker, the competitive search equilibrium is efficient (Moen, 1997; Shimer, 1996). I show that if firms wish to employ multiple workers, then hiring will not generally be efficient if firms post only a single wage. Efficiency requires that firms commit to hire a fixed number of workers at the posted wage, to pay all applicants, or to make wages contingent on the number of applicants. I show that if firms post only a wage, the amount of inefficiency is highest at intermediate levels of labor market tightness. Efficiency under wage posting is restored in a dynamic model if the duration for which firms commit to posted contracts becomes small. I next calibrate a continuous-time version of the model to US data. Under the benchmark parametrization and in response to plausible business-cycle shocks to productivity, the model does not produce fluctuations in unemployment that match the amplitude of such fluctuations in US data.(cont.) It appears that the existence of firms that wish to employ multiple workers is not per se a source of much amplification. Finally, Daron Acemoglu and I present a generalization of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) search model of unemployment which incorporates both intensive and extensive margins of employment creation. Firms possess a production technology with diminishing returns to labor, and recruit workers by posting vacancies. Entry by new firms corresponds to the extensive margin of employment creation, while job creation by existing firms captures the intensive margin. As in the baseline DMP model and theories of the firm developed by Stole and Zwiebel (1996a,b) and Wolinsky (2000), wages are determined by continuous bargaining between the firm and its employees. We characterize the steady-state equilibrium in this class of models and discuss the implications of various different types of shocks on the equilibrium unemployment rate.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis consists of three essays on aggregate and individual consumption fluctuations. Chapter 1 develops a quantitative model to explore aggregate and individual consumption dynamics when the income process exhibits regime-switching features, and compares its performance with the conventional linear model. For this purpose, I consider an economy populated by a large number of consumers whose incomes are subject to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. The notable element of the model is that a latent regime-switching stochastic variable governs both the trend growth of the aggregate component and the counter-cyclical variances of the idiosyncratic components in individual earnings. I demonstrate that the model can provide a reasonable description of the cyclical behavior of actual consumption fluctuations, and can successfully replicate some key empirical properties of aggregate consumption growth, such as smaller volatility than income growth, greater volatility in recessions than in expansions, and a negatively skewed and leptokurtic distribution, while the typical linear model fails to do so.(cont.) The model highlights that the interaction between aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, shifts in the cross-sectional distribution of individual consumers' optimal consumption decisions, and learning about the underlying business-cycle regime play a critical role in explaining aggregate consumption dynamics. In addition, comparison between individual and aggregate consumption and aggregation issues are addressed. Finally, I show that the regime-switching features, combined with heteroskedastic income risk, can account for more than 50% of aggregate consumption fluctuations, but less than 4% of individual consumption fluctuations. It is widely believed that utility maximization implies that expected consumption growth should be higher in recessions which are associated with higher income uncertainty because consumers with precautionary saving motives save more to tilt up their consumption path. Evidence in the literature, however, does not seem to support this prediction. Chapter 2 tries to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations. First, noting that recessions are times of both higher income uncertainty and lower income growth, I perform comparative experiments to see each effect on expected consumption growth.(cont.) Higher income uncertainty indeed increases expected consumption growth, while lower income growth does the opposite. Next, in a calibrated switching regime income process example, where recessions are associated with lower income growth and higher uncertainty, I show the net effect may well decrease, rather than increase, expected consumption growth. I then compare my results to the usual argument in the literature, based on approximations to the Euler equation. Chapter 3 develops econometric methods to estimate consumers' risk aversion and time discount rate parameters in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model set-up, using the simulated method of moments (SMM) technique. This approach, based on a numerical solution algorithm, offers several advantages over traditional methods, which directly estimate a (linearized) Euler equation. In particular, the model allows us to incorporate a possibly non-linear underlying income process and the selection of moment conditions into the estimation procedure. I also consider two extensions by (1) allowing for the parameters of the model to be state-dependent and (2) incorporating the agent's learning about the latent aggregate state.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis is composed of three chapters, each includes one paper. The first chapter includes a paper that analyses the impact of terror on consumption and investment. This paper provides evidence on how consumers and investors react to terror attacks based on a new database from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. An increase in terror casualties triggers households to alter their perceived personal security and expected future income. Only ex-post do households distinguish a temporary from a permanent increase in terror casualties. A temporary increase in the number of terror casualties causes a bust-boom cycle of durables consumption and irreversible investment; nondurables are affected less. A permanent increase in the number of terror casualties causes a one-time drop in consumption. This is in line with the theory on irreversible investment and durables consumption: terror generates temporary uncertainty about personal security and future income, which in turn causes a bust-boom cycle of durables due to bunching of purchases in later periods. A permanent increase in terror causes neither bunching nor boom. Similar results are obtained for the effect of terror casualties on fixed capital. The second chapter includes a paper titled: \"Arbitrage Tests of Israel's Currency Options Markets.\" The aims of this study are threefold. First, we test the validity of the Black and Scholes (B-S) model as a naive option-pricing model for the case of an exchange-rate target zone. We find that although we cannot reject the weakly efficient market hypothesis (except for very-near-maturity deep-ITM options), we can reject the strongly efficient market and/or the B-S model validity hypotheses.(cont.) The banking sector could have utilized arbitrage opportunities, notably for out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and far-from-maturity options, especially when employing inter-temporal weighted-average implied standard deviation. Second, we estimate the liquidity premium for currency options by using a unique data set that allows us to comparing tradable and non-tradable options. The liquidity premium, though positive in average, is found to be negative for some options. This is an indication that there could have been arbitrage opportunities, especially for the banking sector. Third, we examine the null hypothesis that the Israeli currency options market is efficient, an issue that has not been investigated. Ex-post tests of arbitrage and dominance conditions do not permit rejection of the null hypothesis, except for very-near maturity, deep-in-the-money (ITM) options. The paper enhances the literature by using a unique database from the Israeli currency options market, which includes currency options traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and (non-tradable) Bank of Israel currency options. In addition, this paper examines B-S when the exchange rate is confined to a target zone. The third chapter includes a paper that analyses the robustness of exchange rate models, unit roots and cointegration. Three basic models have been proposed to explain the exchange rate: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the Balassa-Samuelson model and the random walk model. The robustness of these models is not merely a statistical curiosity but has important implications in many economic and financial models. During the last two decades ...",

        "Abstrak": "The first chapter of this dissertation examines the behavior of long- and short-term capital gains distributions after the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, which lowered the maximum tax rate on long-term gains. Using a panel of mutual fund data, I examine the ratio of long-term to total gains distributions around the time of the Act, and find that fund managers appear to tilttheir distributions towards the long-term after 1997. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that managers are tax-sensitive, and the estimates are robust to the inclusion of fund-level fixed effects and other controls. I also examine fund capital gains patterns in a difference-in-differences framework, comparing actively managed to index funds; this technique gives a lower-bound estimate of the increase in the fraction of gains paid-out as long-term after the Act of five percentage points. The second chapter examines equity mutual fund dividend yields. Dividends are highly-taxed for individual investors, but tax-favored for corporate investors. Consequently, I hypothesize that corporate investors may prefer to hold higher-dividend yield funds than non-corporate investors. I use institutional funds as a proxy for corporate, trust, or non-profit shareholders, and find that these funds do have systematically higher dividend yields than their retail counterparts. These results are consistent with the tax clientele hypothesis, and are robust to the inclusion of a number of fund- and industry-level controls.(cont.) Chapter three, co-authored with James Poterba, documents the increasing use of redemption fees throughout the mutual fund industry. These fees are levied against investors who liquidate their positions before a specified time, and are paid back into the fund to compensate existing investors for the negative externalities of redemptions. We find that foreign and sector funds are more likely to impose redemption fees, and that institutional funds are less likely to have fees. Using data from the SEC, we find that the largest funds with redemption fees collected nearly $58 million in fees in 2000. We also find that funds with redemption fees appear to have lower turnover and higher returns than their no-fee counterparts, controlling for time, fund objective, and other characteristics.",

        "Abstrak": "(cont.) the auctioneer are analyzed.This thesis consists of three essays in auction and market design. Chapter 1 studies sequential auctions with potential entry between rounds. In a simple model with two rounds, two initial bidders and one potential entrant, it is shown that every symmetric equilibrium first round bidding function must feature some degree of pooling. In one such equilibrium, the symmetric bidding function is a step function, reflecting the desire of present bidders to hide information from the potential entrant in order to deter entry. Extensions of the simple model to multiple incumbents and uncertain presence of the entrant are discussed. Chapter 2 studies the choice between two modes of trade: selling at a posted price or bargaining. It is shown that the choice of one of the regimes may serve as a signal of quality of the good, otherwise unobservable to buyers. The main result of this chapter is that both modes can coexist on the same market. This result holds both when sellers can choose the quality is given exogenously and when they can not. Chapter 3 examines origins of rules restricting the set of auction formats available to the seller in an auction. While wider set of possible auction formats available to the seller may increase his expected revenue, choice of one of the formats discloses seller's private information; the seller may want to commit to an auction format ex ante to avoid this disclosure. The value of commitment is analyzed in the context of announced versus hidden reservation value choice. A policy of conditional disclosure is introduced, which generates revenue higher than that generated by either of the unconditional policies.

        "Abstrak": "This thesis addresses the question of how direction selectivity (DS) arises in the mouse retina. DS has long been observed in retinal ganglion cells, and more recently confirmed in the starburst amacrine cell. Upstream retinal bipolar cells, however, have been shown to lac, indicating that the mechanism that gives rise to DS lies in the inner plexiform layer, where the axons of bipolar cells costratify with amacrine and ganglion cells. We reconstructed a region of the IPL and identified cell types within it, and have discovered a mechanism which may explain the origin of DS activity in the mammalian retina, which relies on what we call \"space-time wiring specificity.\" It has been suggested that a DS signal can arise from non-DS excitatory inputs if at least one among spatially segregated inputs transmits its signal with some delay, which we extend to consider also a difference in the degree to which the signal is sustained. Previously, it has been supposed that this delay occurs within the starburst amacrine cells' dendrites. We hypothesized an alternative, presynaptic mechanism. We observed that different bipolar cell types, which are believed to express different degrees of sustained activity, contact different regions of the starburst amacrine cell dendrite, giving rise to a space-time wiring specifity that should produce a DS signal. We additionally provide a model that predicts the strength of DS as a function of the spatial segregation of inputs and the temporal delay.",

        "Abstrak": "Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles during operation is a challenging task. Numerous factors such as process noise, sensor noise, incorrect model etc. can yield uncertainty in robot's state. Especially for tracked vehicles operating on rough terrain, vehicle slip due to vehicle terrain interaction affects the vehicle system significantly. In such cases, the motion planning of the autonomous vehicle must be performed robustly, considering the uncertain factors in advance of the real-time navigation. The primary contribution of this thesis is to present a robust optimal global planner for autonomous tracked vehicles operating in off-road terrain with uncertain slip. In order to achieve this goal, three tasks must be completed. First, the motion planner must be able to work efficiently under the non-holonomic vehicle system model. An approximate method is applied to the tracked vehicle system ensuring both optimality and efficiency. Second, the motion planner should ensure robustness. For this, a robust incremental sampling based motion planning algorithm (CC-RRT*) is combined with the LQG-MP algorithm. CC-RRT* yields the optimal and probabilistically feasible trajectory by using a chance constrained approach under the RRT* framework. LQG-MP provides the capability of considering the role of compensator in the motion planning phase and bounds the degree of uncertainty to appropriate size. Third, the effect of slip on the vehicle system must be modeled properly. This can be done in advance of operation if we have experimental data and full information about the environment. However, in case where such knowledge is not available, the online slip estimation can be performed using system identification method such as the IPEM algorithm. Simulation results shows that the resulting algorithms are efficient, optimal, and robust. The simulation was performed on a realistic scenario with several important factors that can increase the uncertainty of the vehicle. Experimental results are also provided to support the validity of the proposed algorithm. The proposed framework can be applied to other robotic systems where robustness is an important issue.",

Global coupled climate models and earth system models, however, vary widely in their simulations of the Southern Ocean and its role in, and response to, the ongoing anthropogenic trend. Due to the region's complex water-mass structure and dynamics, Southern Ocean carbon and heat uptake depend on a combination of winds, eddies, mixing, buoyancy fluxes, and topography. Observationally based metrics are critical for discerning processes and mechanisms, and for validating and comparing climate and earth system models. New observations and understanding have allowed for progress in the creation of observationally based data/model metrics for the Southern Ocean. Metrics presented here provide a means to assess multiple simulations relative to the best available observations and observational products. Climate models that perform better according to these metrics also better simulate the uptake of heat and carbon by the Southern Ocean. This report is not strictly an intercomparison, but rather a distillation of key metrics that can reliably quantify the \"accuracy\" of a simulation against observed, or at least observable, quantities. One overall goal is to recommend standardization of observationally based benchmarks that the modeling community should aspire to meet in order to reduce uncertainties in climate projections, and especially uncertainties related to oceanic heat and carbon uptake.",

The [gamma]' volume fraction was measured by point counting and direct area measurement. The data, however, were found inadequate to accurately determine the operating temperature. The interdiffusion between the platinum aluminide coating and the base material was modeled with an error function solution to Fick's Second Law. This method provided an estimation of the operating temperature that varied from the reported operating temperature by only 1%.",

The precise measurement of the B/C ratio from 1.9 GV to 2.6 TV, based on 2.3 million boron and 8.3 million carbon nuclei collected by AMS during the first 5 years of operation, is presented. The detailed variation with rigidity of the B/C spectral index is reported for the first time. The B/C ratio does not show any significant structures in contrast to many cosmic ray models that require such structures at high rigidities. Remarkably, above 65 GV, the B/C ratio is well described by a single power law R[superscript Δ] with index Δ=-0.333±0.014(fit)±0.005(syst), in good agreement with the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence which predicts Δ=-1/3 asymptotically.",

It has been suggested that multiple items may be held in memory by oscillatory activity across neuronal populations, but yet there is little direct evidence. Here, we show that neuronal information about two objects held in short-term memory is enhanced at specific phases of underlying oscillatory population activity. We recorded neuronal activity from the prefrontal cortices of monkeys remembering two visual objects over a brief interval. We found that during this memory interval prefrontal population activity was rhythmically synchronized at frequencies around 32 and 3 Hz and that spikes carried the most information about the memorized objects at specific phases. Further, according to their order of presentation, optimal encoding of the first presented object was significantly earlier in the 32 Hz cycle than that for the second object. Our results suggest that oscillatory neuronal synchronization mediates a phase-dependent coding of memorized objects in the prefrontal cortex. Encoding at distinct phases may play a role for disambiguating information about multiple objects in short-term memory.",

        "Abstrak": "We numerically examine solutal convection in porous media, driven by the dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO[subscript 2]) into water—an effective mechanism for CO[subscript 2] storage in saline aquifers. Dissolution is associated with slow diffusion of free-phase CO[subscript 2] into the underlying aqueous phase followed by density-driven convective mixing of CO[subscript 2] throughout the water-saturated layer. We study the fluid dynamics of CO[subscript 2] convection in the single aqueous-phase region. A comparison is made between two different boundary conditions in the top of the formation: (i) a constant, maximum aqueous-phase concentration of CO[subscript 2], and (ii) a constant, low injection-rate of CO[subscript 2], such that all CO[subscript 2] dissolves instantly and the system remains in single phase. The latter model is found to involve a nonlinear evolution of CO[subscript 2] composition and associated aqueous-phase density, which depend on the formation permeability. We model the full nonlinear phase behavior of water-CO[subscript 2] mixtures in a confined domain, consider dissolution and fluid compressibility, and relax the common Boussinesq approximation. We discover new flow regimes and present quantitative scaling relations for global characteristics of spreading, mixing, and a dissolution flux in two- and three-dimensional media for both boundary conditions. We also revisit the scaling behavior of Sherwood number (Sh) with Rayleigh number (Ra), which has been under debate for porous-media convection. Our measurements from the solutal convection in the range 1500≲Ra≲135000 show that the classical linear scaling Sh ∼ Ra is attained asymptotically for the constant-concentration case. Similarly, linear scaling is recovered for the constant-flux model problem. The results provide a new perspective into how boundary conditions may affect the predictive powers of numerical models, e.g., for both the short-term and long-term dynamics of convective mixing rate and dissolution flux in porous media at a wide range of Rayleigh numbers.",

In Dec, 2005, Intel and its partner, QinetiQ, Ltd, announced 85nm gate length enhancement and depletion mode InSb quantum well transistors. Such transistors can operate as high as 305GHz and power consumption is reduced by a factor of 10. In this thesis, the emerging InSb transistor technology is discussed in details. Given its superior performance, it may complement silicon transistor to extend Moore's law in the next decade. The prospect of InSb transistor is also compared with other nanotechnology transistors, such as carbon nanotube and silicon nanowire. Several potential markets are figured out, namely, microprocessor, low noise amplifier and millimeter wave device. Related patents are evaluated. It is found that most of the patents are held by Intel's partner, QinetiQ Ltd. and thus patents issue would not block the launch of products. A joint venture or strategy alliance model is proposed to reduce the risk of investment. In addition, a cost model is presented at the end. It is concluded that cheap silicon substrate and large enough production scale are two crucial factors for the commercialization success of InSb transistor technology.",

It is subserved by plasticity in many neural systems, including neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortex), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems interact during category learning. Corticostriatal loops may mediate recursive, bootstrapping interactions between fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between acquisition of details of experiences and generalization across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task.",

Neuroligin (NL) and Neurexin (Nrxn) proteins are trans-synaptic adhesion molecules that are important in validation and maturation of specific synapses. NL isoforms NL1 and NL2 have specific functional roles in excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, but the molecular basis behind this distinction is still unclear. We show here that the extracellular domain of NL2 confers its unique ability to enhance inhibitory synaptic function when overexpressed in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas NL1 normally only promotes excitatory synapses. This specificity is conferred by presynaptic Nrxn isoforms, as NL1 can also induce functional inhibitory synapse connections when the presynaptic interneurons ectopically express an Nrxn isoform that binds to NL1. Our results indicate that trans-synaptic interaction with differentially expressed presynaptic Nrxns underlies the distinct functions of NL1 and NL2, and is sufficient to induce functional inhibitory synapse formation.",

        "Abstrak": "A heterogeneous LWR core design, which employs a thorium/uranium once through fuel cycle, is optimized for good economics, wide safety margins, minimal waste burden and high proliferation resistance. The focus is on the Whole Assembly Seed and Blanket (WASB) concept, in which the individual seed and blanket regions each occupy one full-size PWR assembly in a checkerboard core configuration. A Westinghouse 4-loop 1150 MWe PWR was selected as the reference plant design. The optimized heterogeneous core, after several iterations, employs 84 seed assemblies and 109 blanket assemblies. Each assembly has the characteristic 17x17 rod array. The seed fuel is composed of 20 w/o enriched annular UO2 pellets. Erbium is used in the fresh seed to help regulate local power peaking and reduce soluble boron concentrations. Erbium was evenly distributed into all pin central holes except for the peripheral pins and four corner pins of each assembly where more erbium was used due to their higher power level. The blanket fuel is a mixture of 87% ThO2 - 13% UO2 by volume, where the uranium is enriched to 10 w/o. The blanket fuel pin diameter is larger than the seed fuel pin diameter. There are two separate fuel management flows: a standard three-batch scheme is adopted for the seed (18 month cycle length) and a single-batch for the blanket, which is to stay in the core for up to 9 seed cycles. The WASB core design was analyzed by well known tools in the nuclear industry. The neutronic analysis was performed using the Studsvik Core Management System (CMS), which consists of three codes: CASMO-4, TABLES-3 and SIMULATE-3. Thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed using EPRI's VIPRE-01.(cont.) Fuel performance was analyzed using FRAPCON. The radioactivity and decay heat from the spent seed and blanket fuel were studied using MIT's MCODE (which couples MCNP and ORIGEN) to do depletion calculations, and ORIGEN to analyze the spent fuel characteristics after discharge. The analyses show that the WASB core can satisfy the requirements of fuel cycle length and safety margins of conventional PWRs. The coefficients of reactivity are comparable to currently operating PWRs. However, the reduction in effective delayed neutron fraction (eff) requires careful review of the control systems because of its importance to short term power transients. Whole core analyses show that the total control rod worth of the WASB core is about 1/3 less than those of a typical PWR for a standard arrangement of Ag-In-Cd control rods in the core. The use of enriched boron in the control rods can effectively improve the control rod worth. The control rods have higher worth in the seed than in the blanket. Therefore, a new loading pattern has been designed so that almost all the control rods will be located in seed assemblies. However, the new pattern requires a redesign of the vessel head of the reactor, which is an added cost in case of retrofitting in existing PWRs. Though the WASB core has high power peaking factors, acceptable MDNBR in the core can be achieved under conservative assumptions by using grids with large local pressure loss coefficient in the blanket. However, the core pressure drop will increase by 70% ...",

The first chapter, Productions, looks not just at how fakes are made but what makes a fake, at how fake branded luxury goods are produced, both materially and immaterially. The second, Exchanges, examines the three most common sites of exchange, street markets, online message boards, and purse parties, and how the culture of exchange at each site produces a value specific to that site. The final chapter, Ownerships, explores how owners and observers make meaning from branded luxury goods, real and fake, and how, more specifically, how emerging legal discourses misunderstand the nature of creativity in fashion. To conclude, it considers what it might mean, more holistically, to use branded objects made, bought, and used outside of authorized channels, to constitute everyday life.",

        "Abstrak": "In the field of capital budgeting traditionally the widely accepted net-present-value (NPV) technique is used to capture a project's value. However, this approach fails to quantify managerial and operational flexibility and strategic interactions. The underlying analysis deals with the subject of resource allocation or capital budgeting under uncertainty, particularly with the valuation of managerial and operating flexibility as real options. Similar to options on financial assets, real options involve decisions or rights, with no obligation, to acquire or exchange an asset or project for a pre-specified price. Within the shipping industry the application of real options on operating vessels as strategic decision tools has so far been more or less neglected, since only few players are familiar with the option  theory. A charterer operating a vessel may have an agreement with the owner to acquire the ship at some future date, giving him the option, without obligation, to do so. This flexibility to undertake a vessel acquisition provides the charterer with a certain value, depending on the movements of the market. This paper initially introduces the general option pricing theory applied to financial securities. Furthermore, an alternative way of modeling the stochastic nature of time charter. equivalent spot rates for the bulk freight market is presented. It is proposed to abandon the Geometric Brownian motion and, instead, to apply a mean reverting process, such as the OmsteinUhlenbeck process, to replicate the freight rates. Based on these findings, closed form option valuation tools are applied to a Panamax vessel type for one specific route, capturing the mean reverting character of the ship's cash flows. The results of the option valuation are discussed considering their practicability. Finally, recommendations for future research are given.",

        "Abstrak": "We present an analysis of the magnetic activity, photometry and kinematics of approximately 70000 M dwarfs from the Sloan digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. This new analysis explores the spatial distribution of these M dwarf properties as a function of vertical distance from the Galactic plane (Z) and distance from the Galactic center (R). We confirm the established trends of decreasing magnetic activity, as measured by Ha emission, with increasing distance from the mid-plane of the disk but also observe a new trend in Galactocentric radius, apparent in the analysis of spectral types M3 and M4 of a small increase in activity with increasing R. Examining the color indices r - z, r - i and g - r from the SDSS ugriz photometry reveals noticeable gradients in the vertical direction but not in the radial direction. To analyze the kinematics we develop a new technique utilizing probability distributions and a pseudo-montecarlo data fitting scheme to determine the parameters (o- 1, pi, 0-2, 12) and normalization of the underlying Gaussians making up the kinematic distributions of the stellar population. We analyze each of the spatial velocities VR, Vz , and Ve defined in a Galactocentric cylindrical coordinate system. The kinematic analysis reproduced previous trends of increasing dispersion with increasing distance from the mid-plane, but with much greater accuracy and reliability and to distances farther out away from the mid-plane. The analysis did not reveal any significant kinematic trends in the radial domain.",

CoRoT occupies an orbit which periodically carries it through the Van Allen Belts, resulting in a very high level of high outliers in the flux data. Known systematics and outliers were removed from the data and the remaining scatter was evaluated using the median of absolute deviations from the median (MAD), a measure of scatter which is robust to outliers. The level of scatter (evaluated with MAD) present in this data is indicative of the lower limits on the size of planets detectable by CoRoT or a similar satellite. The MAD for CoRoT stars is correlated with the magnitude. The brightest stars observed by CoRoT display scatter of approximately 0.02 percent, while the median value for all stars is 0.16 percent.",

Due to the immense forces present in the disk, interesting and complex magnetic field structures can be set up within the disk. The influence of gravity on these structures is explored via a higher-order expansion of the gravitational potential. We consider several cases: the case when the Lorentz force is negligible and the case when the Lorentz force becomes significant in the dynamics of the disk. When the Lorentz force is negligible, we find using the Ferraro Co-rotation Theorem that the strength of the magnetic field increases near the event horizon. As the strength of the Lorentz force increases and it is included in our analysis, we discover that it leads to a periodic \"crystal\" structure of concentric rings of current. This structure is significantly affected by gravitational forces: we find a solution to the equations of motion that shows a composite structure within the disk. We discuss the general relativistic effects near the event horizon using the Pseudo- Newtonian potential in this limit. In addition, we consider an alternate derivation of the equation of motion describing the behavior of the magnetic field and discuss its consequences.",

Recent theoretical advances now make it possible to model the impact of this wave emission on generic (eccentric and inclined) black hole orbits, allowing us to push beyond the handful of constrained (circular or equatorial) cases that previous work considered. This thesis presents the first systematic study of how generic black hole orbits evolve due to gravitational-wave emission. In addition to extending the class of orbits which can be analyzed, we also introduce a new formalism for solving for the wave equation which describes radiative backreaction. This approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the radiation field originally introduced by Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST), and was then adapted for numerical analysis by Fujita and Tagoshi (FT). We find that the MST-FT formalism allows us to compute various quantities significantly more accurately than previous work, even in strong field regimes. We use this code to explore the location in orbital parameter space of the surface at which the evolution of orbital eccentricity changes sign from negative (orbits circularize) to positive (orbits become more eccentric).",

A substantial contributor to the Advanced LIGO noise in the 1-10 Hz range is Newtonian (or gravity gradient) noise which arises from local fluctuations in the Earth's gravitational field. Density fluctuations from seismic activity as well as acoustic and turbulent phenomenon in the Earth's atmosphere both contribute to slight variations in the local value of g. Given the direct coupling of gravitational fields to mass the LIGO test masses cannot be shielded from this noise.

        "Abstrak": "The building of a muon collider is motivated by the desire to collide point-like particles while reducing the limitations imposed by synchrotron radiation. The many challenges unique to muon accelerators are derived from the short lifetime of the muons. The muons must be produced, then formed into a beam and accelerated to their final energy in less than a few milliseconds in the lab frame. One idea for accomplishing this is called a helical cooling channel (HCC), and requires placing the accelerating structure in a solenoid. The RF (radio frequency) accelerating structure in a muon accelerator should be short in the longitudinal direction, small enough in the transverse direction to fit inside the solenoids of the helical cooling channel, and have the highest possible electric field gradient. A RF cavity that meets these requirements is crucial to the development of a muon collider. There is an additional constraint if an existing source of RF power is to be used, as the frequency of the lowest RF cavity mode should match the frequency of the power source. At Fermilab, the klystrons produce RF power at 800MHz. The resonant frequency of an RF cavity depends inversely on the radius of the cavity, as well as the dielectric constant of the material within the cavity. A standard vacuum cavity with a resonant frequency of 800 MHz is too large to fit within the solenoids. This paper studies one method of avoiding this limitation by placing a dielectric material within the cavity. Another problem faced by a cavity within an HCC is the effect of the magnetic field. The solenoid field will serve to focus electrons emitted from the sides of the cavity, causing breakdown at lower electric fields than those possible without the solenoid. By inserting the dielectric at a high electric field point, electrons emitted from the wall behind the dielectric will be attenuated before they can avalanche and cause breakdown. The effect of this dielectric is modeled in Microwave Studio to determine the right size and shape for the dielectric given, and several prototype cavities are built and tested with a network analyzer. Our proof of concept experiment shows the feasibility of further developing the design of dielectric loaded RF cavities. A design for a cavity to be used at higher power is discussed, along with the testing procedures that will be followed.",

A numerical approach for matching measured and computed resonance frequencies was developed and used in deducing the elastic constants of the composite.

We extend the analysis of thrust to the peak region of the distribution, in which a nonperturbative soft function encoding the effects of large-angle soft gluon radiation plays a significant role. We write the soft function as an infinite sum of basis functions and use a truncated version in our calculations, allowing us to fit for the basis coefficients ci with all available thrust data from center-of-mass energies Q = 35 to 207 GeV. To characterize the soft function independently of a particular parameterization, we present fit results for its cumulant moments, denoted [Omega]1, up to i = 4. We compute experimental uncertainties from the fits and theory uncertainties using a random scan in the space of the undetermined parameters of the theory. Our approach significantly improves the fit in the peak region, reducing the minimum X2/d.o.f. value from to 5.29 using the best fit form the tail region without fitting basis functions, to 1.23 using five basis functions. We find [Omega]1 = 0.387 ± (0.003)exp ±(0.026)pert GeV, indicating that the peak region determines [Omega] with considerably more precision than the tail.

Many Kepler M, K, and G stars show modulations in flux due to rotating star spots, and these have been previously investigated by a number of different groups. Rotational periodicities mediated by the rotation of stellar spots were identified using Fourier transforms of Kepler light curves. Additional analytical techniques including the folding of light curves and the utilization of 'sonograms' were used to support our hypothesis that these periodicities arise from the rotation of stellar spots as opposed to planetary transits, binary eclipses, or stellar pulsations. In total, 293 of the Kepler K-star targets exhibited rotational periods, Prot, of 2 days or less. Of these 293 targets, 17 systems show two or more independent short periods within the same photometric aperture. Images from the United Kingdom Infra Red Telescope (UKIRT) provide evidence for my conclusion that these 17 targets with multiple periods are likely to be relatively young binary and triple K-star systems. The ~ 2% occurrence rate of rapid rotation among the 14,440 K star targets is consistent with spin evolution models that presume an initial contraction phase followed by spin down due to magnetic braking where typical K stars would be expected to spend up to a few hundred million years before slowing down to a rotation period of more than 2 days.",

Bluefin Tuna, for example, are known to migrate long distances while also being able to perform high acceleration maneuvers and swim at speeds in excess of 100 km/hr. To achieve performance on par with biological swimmers, a machine must replicate the fluid dynamic interactions between a fish's body and water as well as the efficient actuation of its control surfaces. It isn't feasible to design actuators that are well suited for such devices without a relationship between the kinematics of a flexible body in water and the forces on it. It is difficult to derive these forces analytically, however, since this would require a solution to Navier-Stokes equations. It is also challenging to design a mechanical drivetrain that fits within the envelope of a fish and can generate comparable forces and displacements. This thesis explores an experimental approach to designing an efficient, self-propelled underwater vehicle that is modeled after a .681 m long Skipjack Tuna. Analytical models are used to estimate the joint torques required to maintain biological swimming kinematics, to select optimal actuators, and to size the components of a drivetrain for the device. The drivetrain of this prototype has rigid transmission elements and is designed with low friction drive components. These properties will allow us to measure the actuator torque profiles and from them estimate the torque applied to each segment of the device to inform the design of specialized actuators. The machine is mostly assembled, and position control loops were designed and tuned based on the measured open loop transfer functions of the joints in air.

The subunits were created by two different approaches, through the use delrin, and through injection molding. The angling of the subunits was approached through a fixture designed for this application and a wedge. Finally, the joining and assembly was achieved by using glue.

These values range from being fairly predictable (energy and water savings can be recorded over time) to relatively uncertain (productivity/health benefits are somewhat arbitrary and subjective). Based on a 20-year Net Present Value analysis with a 5% real interest rate, a recent study by the California Sustainable Energy Task Force showed the total financial benefits of green design to be $50/ft2 - $75/ft2, depending on the building's level of LEED Certification. This number is over ten times bigger than the average 2% cost premium calculated for the 33 green buildings they analyzed-about $3-5/ft in California.(cont.) Energy savings alone, from reduced energy demand and decreased peak load, was calculated to be $5.79, which already exceeds the cost premium. Conservative calculations based on a study on Norway building retrofits show that the cost of energy savings ranges from 1-4 cents/kWh. Comparing this number to the cost of various modes of electricity generation, ranging from 3-80 cents/kWh, it is clear that the cost of generating electricity greatly exceeds the cost of saving energy through energy efficient buildings. Thus, green buildings are cost effective and should be more widely adopted.",

        "Abstrak": "A method was developed to create a nonlinear density gradient in a tank of water. Such gradients are useful for studying internal waves, an ocean phenomenon that plays an important role in climate and ocean circulation. The method was developed by expanding on the two-tank system currently used to create linear density gradients. A mathematical model of the two-tank system was used and a Matlab script was written to solve the model for the required flow rates in the system given a desired density gradient. The method was tested by creating three different density gradients: a linear gradient, a hyperbolic gradient, and a two-layer gradient. It was discovered that for a two-layer gradient the flow rates for each layer must be calculated independently of each other, because of problems integrating over a density gradient with a non-continuous slope. It was also discovered that the system failed at very low flow rates; insufficient mixing in the two-tank system led to gradients weaker than expected. Overall, the measured gradients matched up well with the expected gradients, and it was concluded that the system can successfully produce nonlinear density gradients.",

        "Abstrak": "Endothelial and smooth muscle cells are the core of the vascular system. Vessels are created and repaired through the processes of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Endothelial cells are the initial cells that migrate and proliferate during the process, followed by smooth muscle cell movement and differentiation. The recruitment of smooth muscle cells is not fully understood, and if understood would unlock a crucial step in the growth and remodeling of vessels. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells have been extensively studied in two dimensional models and the physiologic factors that affect their function and survival have been well documented. In living organisms, vascular tissue, consisting primarily of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, grows in three dimensions where it is constantly exposed to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli. Thus, a controllable three dimensional environment is desired to study these interactions. The cells do not move instantaneously or in direct paths, hence, it is beneficial to be able to study the cells at multiple time points and over long periods of time. Most in vitro studies have not been conducted for more than 100 hours, while in vivo experiments have been continued for months.(cont.) To fully understand in vitro growth of smooth muscle cells, the growth should be monitored continually and the observation technique must be able to support to this. Accordingly, we have developed a microscope stage environmental chamber that houses a three dimensional bioreactor for vascular tissue engineering in order to monitor tissue function in real-time. We have demonstrated the capabilities of the environmental control chamber by growing smooth muscle precursor cells (10Tl/2 cells) in the three dimensional bioreactor and monitored the cells for growth, migration and proliferation. Critical to the chamber design was the control of temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, and humidity. Furthermore, smooth muscle precursor cell (10T1/2 cell) migration and morphology was observed in response to varying concentrations of Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (PDGF-BB), an endothelial cell-derived growth factor that is important for smooth muscle recruitment to remodeling blood vessels. Using a migration assay technique that observes the general trends of cell movement through the device, the cells exposed to PDGF-BB have been noted to move more than the cells grown in media without a growth factor. The cells tend to migrate towards the PDGF-BB with great variability.",

The impact, by improving the quality of designs capable by professional engineers by teaching them about using FACT to design flexures, will contribute to higher quality, more agile, and more reliable technology worldwide. The metrological systems designed for the kit were comprised of a system of sensors and data collection apparati to analyze the physical characteristics of a particular type of flexure known as a \"screw flexure\", a compliant mechanism that has a single degree of freedom with coupled translational and rotational motion. Using lead weights of V4 to 2 pounds and two Mitutoyo #ID-S1012E digital Dial Indicators, measurements were taken for the translational and rotational deflection of the screw flexure. The pitch of the screw flexure was found to be 10.512 in/rad, which was a 9.4% error from the expected value of 11.5 in/rad. The experimental setup was a successful tool for teaching FACT methodology in the specific case of the screw flexure.",

A systems model is being developed at MIT for promoting resource efficient housing in New Orleans. The model attempts to capture the urban metabolism of the city by tracking the material and energy flows required of various possible reconstruction scenarios. The model is meant to act as a tool for policy makers to identify the most effective construction methods for a green city. Currently, the model is programmed to provide output values for material use, energy consumption and labor hours during the construction, use, and end-of-life phases of portions of the city's housing stock. While these quantitative results are useful for specialists to understand a given scenario, they are not useful for policy makers. My thesis project will focus on comparing the merits and drawbacks of applying various standard indicators to New Orleans construction methods. This includes, but is not limited to, Gross Domestic Product per capita and Species Diversity. Next, my work with this project will focus on assessing existing composite indicators based on their relevance to the model and their usability by policy makers. Understanding the merits and downfalls of various composite indicators will allow policy makers to choose an appropriate metric for comparing construction option, and make informed decisions about incentive programs for the various stages of reconstruction in New Orleans. It is the intention of the project to find indicators that can be generalized for use in other locations in conjunction with future models of urban metabolism yet to be developed.",

        "Abstrak": "Given the health and weight gain concerns plaguing the country, there is currently a great need for products that encourage athletic activity. A robotic pacing device that facilitates running along a track was developed to help fulfill this requirement. The need for this device, determined from interviews and a survey of experienced running athletes and coaches, was found to be substantial for a number of age groups and experience levels of runners. An experimental robot prototype was designed and manufactured to aid in pacing runners around a track. The robot was designed to accurately follow the lines of the track using IR sensors that detect reflectivity of the track's surface. The prototype was tested and optimized to determine a successful control logic that reduced error and the amount of overshoot the robot experiences as it adjusts to follow the lines at high speeds. Large overshoots lead to robot malfunction and breakdown in the logic as the robot reaches curves in the track. The optimized prototype currently has the capability of running full lengths around various shaped tracks that incorporate white lines dividing dark colored lanes at speeds of up to eight miles per hour. In this form, the robot might be useful for beginner runners, runners that are doing distance training, and physical education classes that have access to running tracks. Future versions of the robot pacing device will need to incorporate additional features in order to be useful for the full range of people that want to use this product, including a flexible user interface that allows users to program the robot to their needs, a more sophisticated robot control system that allows for accurate control based on the dynamics of the robot, and a more durable cover that is easily spotted by runners looking straight ahead.",

Several members of the team decided to continue the project in attempts to create a beta prototype that improved upon the flaws of the old design in attempts to create a patentable product. My area of focus in the redesign was creating the exterior of the joint including the locking pin interface, the alignment of the legs in relation to the joint, and the integration of the joint into the frame. After deliberating the costs and benefits of each feature, it was decided that the joint would have and axial pin, inline legs, and would be welded to the legs of the walker. These features were then used to create a new joint design. The design process was completed by analyzing the new joint for deflection, optimizing it for weight limitations and material costs, and looking at for design for manufacturing and assembly considerations. Overall, the goal of creating a new joint that could be implemented into a future iteration of the walker was achieved.",

First, we quantify the possibility of measuring the temperature of moderately over-dense regions of the IGM at high redshift (z [approx.] 2) using the strongest resonant absorption lines of neutral hydrogen ([lambda]HI = 1215.67 A[ngstroms]) and neutral helium ([lambda]HeI = 584.33 A[ngstroms]). We calculate the fraction of neutral helium in the IGM at z [approx.] 2 by solving a set of photoionization equilibrium equations. Using known distributions of the redshift, column density and Dopper [beta]-parameter of Lyman-[alpha] ac lines, we perform Monte Carlo simulation to create a line list, from which we calculate the number of observable HeI lines. We expect that 4.5% of the HI lines have observable HeI counterparts. Future ultraviolet (UV) telescope with wavelength coverage from 1400 A[ngstroms] to 2400 A[ngstroms] should be able to observe [approx.] 16 HelI lines per line of sight observation. Second, we analyze a combined 171 ksec. spectroscopic observation of the low redshift quasar 3C 273 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We search for the high ionization state lines of OVII and OVIII at redshifts of known intervening OVI absorbers. Detection of associated OVII or OVIII absorptions in the X-ray would suggest the existence of a warm hot component of the Intergalactic Medium at temperature T [approx.] 106 - 107 K. We observe an unresolved OVII line at z [approx.]0 with a maximum Doppler [beta] parameter of 190 km/s. We do not see any associated OVII absorption for a z [approx.] 0.12 OVI absorber at the -3.5[sigma] level. We provide most stringent to date (Chandra resolution limited) upper limit on the temperature of the z [approx.] 0.12 absorber and discuss the possibilities of photoionization and collisional ionization.",

The dual beam heterodyne interferometer (DBHI) is a modified Michelson with a low coherence source and an optical referencing method capable of detecting sub-nanometer optical path changes. In this interferometer, acousto-optical modulators were used to produce an interfering heterodyne signal between the sample and a nearby surface. To cancel the noise, a differential phase measurement was made between this heterodyne signal and a stable reference heterodyne. DBHI has a stability of 30 picometers over 100ms. We have used this interferometer to measure the expansion of the nerve surface during the action potential. We have measured a displacement of 2-6nm using the nerves from the walking leg of a lobster. A correlation experiment showed that the optical phase signal (the swelling) from the axon during action potential can be identified with the electric signal from the extracellular electrophysiology. A dual-beam probe was designed and built based on this interferometer. The probe is a fiber optic unit with an integrated referencing surface. The probe simplified the data taking process as well as improved the overall S/N ratio by 10 times. The compactness of the probe will allow us to obtain full field phase images with high precision and good maneuvering capability. It will be used in future studies of the action potential. Results from the nerve experiment together with the addition of this probe indicate that DBHI is a promising instrument for studying in-vitro neural activity as well as other biophysical applications, such as the study of cochlear dynamics.",

        "Abstrak": "Recent technological advances have allowed for the construction of small (on the order of 100-1000 nm) systems of confined electrons called quantum dots. Often kept within semiconductor heterostructures, these systems are small enough that the electrons within them occupy states with discrete energy levels. Two single quantum dots can be placed next to each other so as to form a double dot, with a host of special properties. Such properties can be probed if one can design the semiconductor heterostructure containing the double dot so that experimenters can tune the confinement potential of the double dot. To assist in the testing of heterostructures before their actual construction, we have created a numerical simulation program that calculates the electrostatic potential and charge density for a quantum double dot housed in a semiconductor heterostructure. Relaxation techniques were used to solve Poisson's equation for the heterostructure. The Thomas-Fermi approximation was used to calculate the electron density as a function of the spatially varying electrostatic potential.(cont.) Certain parameters of the simulation, such as the doping density of the semiconductor material and the electron effective mass, were chosen after trial and error such that the behavior of the simulation matched experimentally observable values, including the electron density within and outside of the quantum double dot region and the depletion voltage. Once the free parameters were chosen, the simulation was used to examine various heterostructure geometries with gates that could tune the confinement potential of the double dot. For example, we analyzed a pincher gate geometry that could split the double dot into two isolated quantum single dots by increasing the potential barrier in the channel connecting the two lobes of the double dot. We discovered that such a tunable dot requires a pincher gate that runs continuously across the bottom of the top gate. We also analyzed how two middle gates., each positioned directly above one of the two lobes of the double dot, can shape the relative sizes of the two connected dots.",

        "Abstrak": "The central theme of this dissertation is that the interaction between firm characteristics and market characteristics is crucial to understanding the evolution of market structure, competition, and firm behavior. I integrate ideas from industrial organization and strategic management in an empirical examination of two innovative industries: pharmaceuticals and laser printers. Chapter 1 provides an overview of this work and discusses its broader implications. In Chapter 2, a range of econometric models for a firm's decision to launch a new pharmaceutical product in 21 OECD countries is estimated. The results suggest that the interaction between the innovating firm, drug, and target country is a critical component of profitability, and that regulations may not affect firms and products uniformly. Chapter 3 considers how entry is influenced by the characteristics of incumbent firms and other potential competitors in a subset of pharmaceutical markets. In an extension to previous structural entry papers, this work explores the effect of competing with other firms that might have an asymmetric effect on profits. Chapter 4 examines the roles of market structure, product characteristics, and firm characteristics in explaining patterns of product entry and exit in the desktop laser printer industry. I find that firms with complementary assets are less sensitive to competition from similar products than are firms without these assets. Not only do the products of complementary asset firms survive longer, but such firms are more likely to introduce new products in crowded market segments.(cont.) Firms without complementary assets tend to introduce new products close to the technological frontier. However, their products exit earlier than those of complementary asset firms. These two types of firms appear to pursue different product market strategies, and the mix of both drives the product life cycle. Understanding entry and exit in these settings may provide insights into the diffusion of other new technologies, because pharmaceuticals and laser printers have a number of features in common with other industries of great interest to managers and policymakers at the moment. Thus the insights from this dissertation may be applicable to broad sectors of the economy.",

        "Abstrak": "Countries that have pursued distortionary macroeconomic policies, including high inflation, large budget deficits and misaligned exchange rates, appear to have suffered bigger exchange rate crises, more macroeconomic volatility and also grown more slowly during the postwar period. Does this reflect the causal effect of these macroeconomic policies on economic outcomes? One reason to suspect that the answer may be no is that countries pursuing poor macroeconomic policies also have weak \"institutions,\" including political institutions that do not constrain politicians and political elites, ineffective enforcement of property rights for investors, widespread corruption, and a high degree of political instability. Two papers in this thesis document that countries that inherited more \"extractive\" institutions from their colonial past were more likely to experience high volatility and economic crises during the postwar period. More specifically, societies where European colonists faced high mortality rates more than 100 years ago are much more volatile and prone to crises. We interpret this relationship as due to the causal effect of institutions on economic outcomes: Europeans did not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions in areas where they faced high mortality. Once we control for the effect of institutions, macroeconomic policies appear to have only a minor impact on volatility and crises. This suggests that distortionary macroeconomic policies are more likely to be symptoms of underlying institutional problems rather than the main causes of economic volatility, and also that the effects of institutional differences on volatility do not appear to be primarily mediated by any of the standard macroeconomic variables.(cont.) Instead, it appears that weak institutions cause volatility through a number of microeconomic, as well as macroeconomic, channels. The third paper reports relevant findings from bond markets. There appears to be no higher cost of borrowing for emerging market borrowers if their bonds are easier to restructure in the case of default. Given our findings on institutions, we suggest that default is likely to remain a recurrent event in many countries, and suggest that bond issuers and lenders should consider bonds that are easier to restructure.",

        "Abstrak": "In Chapter 1, we estimate equilibrium dollar wages for 15 transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union. Equilibrium dollar wages are interpreted as full employment wages consistent with a country's physical and human capital endowment, and estimated by regressing actual dollar wages on productivity and human capital proxies in a short (1990-95) panel of 85 countries. The main results are: (1) equilibrium dollar wages have appreciated steadily in the Baltic countries and fast-reforming CEE transition economies, but have been flat in most CIS countries; and (2) 1996 actual dollar wages remained below estimated equilibrium dollar wages for most but not all transition countries covered. Chapter 2 investigates the effects on firms' budget constraints and on bank loan allocation of introducing a strict bankruptcy law in a transition economy. A stylized model of soft budget constraints suggests that bank loans tend to remain available for financially weaker firms due to the bank's financial commitment problem. The introduction of a strict bankruptcy law helps counter soft budget constraints for firms. As a result, the allocation of financial resources becomes more efficient in the sense of better firms receiving larger loans. Using data for a panel of Hungarian firms in 1989-92, I find evidence that introducing a strict bankruptcy law helped harden the firms' budget constraints.",

A change in US pension law (the Retirement Equity Act of 1984) is used as an instrument to derive predictions from the bargaining model and to contrast these with the predictions of the classical single-utility-function model of the household. In the empirical part of the essay, the predictions of the classical model are rejected in favor of the predictions of the Nash-bargaining model. Second essay studies married couple's dynamic investment and consumption choices under the assumption that the couple cannot commit across time to not to renegotiate their decisions. The inefficiencies that can arise are characterized. Efficiency properties of different divorce asset division regimes are examined. The effect of inability to commit across time on the savings level is examined under a tractable special case of the model. Third essay is coauthored with Professor Peter Diamond and Professor John Geanakoplos. In this essay we extend Arrow's analysis of portfolio choice in a one-period model to savings and portfolio choice in a two-period model.",

In particular, two theoretical scenarios which mimic RHIC data at low PT and which show either no quenching or BDMPS-based quenching at high PT are formulated. The difference between these two scenarios is analyzed for RAA, RCP at different centralities and jet-specific observables such as jet energy spectra, fragmentation functions and jet profiles. We show how these analyses indicate that the large acceptance of the CMS detector, combined with the high granularity in the energy resolution of the calorimeter will be essential tools in studying the phenomenon of jet quenching. Finally, we propose extensions to this work in preparation to analyzing the data from Pb-Pb runs at the LHC. Disclaimer: The work on this thesis does not model the CMS detector geometry with the accuracy required for official analyses, which are fully representative of the CMS detector capabilities. Such analyses require of the full CMS simulation machinery and are left to the CMS Heavy Ion group as a whole.",

Specifically, two types of superfluids are considered, ordinary superfluids where single bosons condense to form a strongly correlated system and superfluids where pairs of bosons condense to form a strongly correlated system while the single bosons remain uncondensed. First, the classical minimum energy configuration for an ordinary superfluid with and without a vortex was calculated. Additionally, the phase diagram for the exotic superfluid created by treating single bosons separately from pairs of bosons was determined as was the minimum energy state for each phase. Using these results, I then quantized the Ginsburg-Landau energy and investigated the possibility of excited states by creating small quantum mechanical oscillations about the classical minima. In the uniform superfluid, both the ordinary and exotic superfluids are able to support low energy excitations in the form of sound waves. In addition, the exotic superfluid has a gapped excitation that is a remanant of the uncondensed boson. Finally, the formalism for studying the modes of small oscillation about the classical minimum was developed for the superfluid vortex.",

In this thesis, experimental evidence is presented illustrating the existence and properties of a previously unknown non-superconducting phase of Na₀Ì£₃CoO₂·1.3H₂0. This evidence includes magnetic susceptibility and x-ray scattering studies which suggest that the appearance of this phase is not due to underhydration and that a superconducting state can be restored via annealing at temperatures above roughly 340 K. Furthermore, synchrotron x-ray scattering of the non-superconductor reveals a 3-c modulation which is clearly absent in the superconducting phase of the material as well as unexpected temperature dependence behavior in the associated Bragg peaks.",

Experiments were based on a theoretical surface energy model proposing enhanced texture of the oxide at the Ag interface after melt-processing. Two classes of samples were processed and compared. Bi-2212 powder was deposited on a thin-foil Ag surface and was melt-processed to yield a 20 ± 10 micron-thick superconducting layer. A subset of these samples were processed with an additional Ag surface pneumatically pressed on top of the superconducting layer before heat treatment. Critical current density (...) measurements were performed in liquid helium and we obtained values ranging from 5,900-36,700 A/cm². A 3-6 fold increase in ..., for samples with the second Ag interface was observed. X-ray diffraction provided a technique for quantifying grain alignment via the Lotgering factor, and indicated samples with the upper Ag interface possess a higher degree of texturing. Our results support the interfacial energy model that a high degree of texture exists at the Ag surface, and provide clear evidence linking materials processing, superconducting grain alignment, and critical current density. Disparities observed in J for similarly processed samples were believed to be a consequence of local regions of alignment and the presence of impurities.",

        "Abstrak": "When a jet of water is in free fall, it rapidly breaks up into drops, since a cylinder of water is unstable. This and other problems involving the form of a volume of water bound by surface tension have yielded a wealth of theoretical and experimental results, and given insight into such phenomena as the shape of the Earth. Particularly interesting behaviors tend to emerge when the fluid in question is rotating; a drop may, for example, form a toroidal or ellipsoidal shape or even stretch out into some multi-lobed, non-axisymmetric form. In this paper, we investigate the properties of a rotating jet of water, and determine what regime of the parameter space are dominated by the various forms of instability. This is both predicted theoretically and demonstrated to be accurate experimentally. If we watch a jet of water as the rotation rate is gradually increased from zero, the drop size will start shrinking gradually, and then suddenly, rather than a single row of drops, we will see the jet breaking up into two-lobed, bar shaped forms, like the rung of a ladder. The point at which this transition occurs is characterized in terms of the rotational Bond number, B₀ = ... . The critical B₀ may be as low as 6, if there is a strong bias imparted by vibration of the table at an appropriate frequency, but for a perfectly quiescent rotating jet the second mode does not become dominant until a higher B₀. As the rotation rate is increased above this, the instability grows gradually more dramatic, and eventually the two lobes of each drop are breaking apart and flying outward. Then a transition to a third mode will occur, with three lobes in each drop; this is possible from a B₀ of 12, and dominant above a B₀ slightly higher than that. In general, mode m may occur whenever(cont.) B₀ > m(m + 1).",

The EMS is a hydraulic damper consisting of a control valve, a pressure operated directional control valve, and a hydraulic cylinder. The system operates entirely upon the forces experienced in the collision and dissipates the energy through a 30° rotation of the occupant's seat back. The damper is designed to withstand the maximum collision forces resulting in front collisions at 30 mph and rear collision at 11 mph. The maximum chest load on an occupant in these collisions is approximately 5,000 lbs. A resulting maximum load of up to 13,900 lbs is exerted on the damper. The damper is designed to dissipate half of this energy and operate at an average load of 6,642 lbs and a corresponding pressure of 4,550 psi. The result of this damper is a 52% reduction in the force exerted on an occupant's chest in a front collision from 5000 lbs to 2390 lbs.",

This relationship was determined and it was discovered that the force was directly proportional to both the deflection and contact area. This information is useful in the design and performance of RFID chips. The RFID chip-antenna interface is the area of greatest power loss in the system, and by determining a relationship to increase the contact area in that region, the power loss to the antenna can be reduced. Moreover, an analysis including asperities on the micro scale geometry of the solids was conducted. In the final approach to the problem, a random distribution of asperity types was analyzed. An expression was derived for the total force applied in terms of a given deflection and a range of asperity radii of curvature. A three-dimensional graph was created to show how each of these variables depends on the each other when asperities exist. This relationship is very significant, because it can be used to improve current RFID chip technology to achieve better performance. This expression can also be used to determine specifications in the manufacturing process to achieve a certain deflection or area of contact between the contacting bodies, thereby improving the current manufacturing process.",

Implications of this study from a macro perspective are multiple. This study can be used as a simplified case study in isolating the effects of the boom and bust cycles of economic industries and quantify its impact to real estate performance. Results found an astonishing correlation. Oil prices, exchange rate, interest rate and employment levels can determine up to 98% of the changes in house prices and rents. Oil prices, representing economic viability of the city, affect the real estate industry with a lag of 7 quarters of approximately two years, while interest rates representing the financial well-being of the city affect house prices and rents with a lag of 2 1/2 years. Foreign exchange rate to the dollar, representing the relative global prosperity, affects real estate prices in one year. House prices seem to be equally sensitive to a positive or negative shock in oil prices, exchange rate, and interest rates. At which, $25/barrel oil price seems to be the \"breakeven\" level at which house prices remain stable, all else equal.(cont.) Above which, prices will continue to appreciate, below which, prices will fall. Not surprisingly, this is the same estimate of the \"breakeven\" point at which the oilsands in Calgary become economically viable. Rents are more sensitive to positive shocks in oil prices, not exchange rate. Inversely, they sensitive to negative shocks in exchange rate, not oil prices. Rents are not sensitive to interest rates.",

        "Abstrak": "Real Options analysis has only begun to be recognized as way to evaluate real estate and is considered \"beyond the cutting edge\" of financial analysis. Several academic papers have looked at ways that real estate can be analyzed using real options; however a universally practical financial model using real options has not successfully been achieved. There are several reasons why real options analysis has not quickly come to the forefront of financial analysis. The first obstacle is that real options analysis can be quite rigorous and mathematically complex, making it difficult to be easily adopted by the everyday analyst. Presently, the most common method of analyzing real estate is using Discounted Cash Flow, which is relatively systematic and can be universally understood by most persons in the finance world. However, real options theory is not nearly as intuitive, even to the most sophisticated financial persons. There is no tried and true, universally recognized methodology for real options analysis of real estate, at least not yet. Discounted Cash Flow does a very good job analyzing most real estate. However, complex, multi-phased, or very speculative developments justify significantly more sophisticated analysis methods, such as real options.(cont.) Real options is relatively new to real estate, and awaits daring pioneers who are willing to create intuitive, thorough, and transparent models that could be used by future real estate analysts before real options analysis will ever become a mainstream method for analyzing real estate. With this in mind, this thesis intends to present a practical, comprehensive, and intuitively transparent financial model using Microsoft Excel for analyzing real estate development projects. This thesis will hopefully serve as a basis for future models, and will aid in others' understanding of the advantages and drawbacks of such analysis and how to properly utilize it as a tool for real-world projects. It is also the intent of this model to be utilized and further refined by future students in the Real Estate Development Studio course at MIT and by real-world real estate practitioners.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis explores one tool of government action - information - and its influence on local policy and planning. This thesis is not a comprehensive account of information-based strategies, which would require far-reaching analysis. Instead, this thesis explores designation as one example of an information-based strategy that is used in planning and development. Specifically, this thesis explores how the act of designating an area as a national historic site (\"designation\") can, if at all, influence local policy and planning and, subsequently, shapes our built environment. Using the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor as a case study, I demonstrate that information strategies such as designation can provide a vital and dynamic planning tool for government. Designation presents a new approach to preservation and development by encouraging dynamic, cross-boundary partnerships that are simultaneously committed to common goals and dynamic enough to respond to the complexities of place. Designation allows local communities to maintain a place-specific approach to planning, while operating within a larger regional network. In the case of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, designation united twenty-four communities across a bi-state region between Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Designation in this region cultivated a coherent and dynamic vision that, when coupled with the organizational structure, can be seen in the physical environment of the Valley. At one scale, this is shown by the reintegration of underused or abandoned structures and the conversion of older structures for new uses.(cont.) At another scale, communities embraced the river as a source for recreation and now promote recreational uses along its shores. At the regional level, communities work to create new regional recreational and interpretive networks. Designation, when used by the Federal government as a tool has the ability to strengthen local governmental bodies as well as society to respond to changes in the economy, culture and environment. Designation as a tool links economic development and cultural programming with preservation efforts within communities and across traditional planning boundaries. Yet, because of a heavy reliance on partnerships, the success of designation as a tool for preservation and development is strongly associated with several key factors relating to the physical, economic and social qualities of place. These include the economic stability of the community, the availability of physical resources for heritage redevelopment, the engagement of the local government, the level of support of the local private sector (both the general public and private sector institutions), and the support and organization of the state.",

The nervous system is believed to be a network of neurons interacting with each other through synaptic connection between axons and dendrites, therefore the neuronal connectivity map not only depicts the underlying anatomy, but also has important behavioral implications. Different approaches have been utilized to decipher neuronal circuits, including electron microscopy (EM) and light microscopy (LM). However, these approaches typically demand extensive sectioning and reconstruction for a brain sample. Recently, tissue clearing methods have enabled the investigation of a fully assembled biological system with greatly improved light penetration. Yet, most of these implementations, still require either genetic or exogenous contrast labeling for light microscopy. Here we demonstrate a high-speed approach, termed as Clearing Assisted Scattering Tomography (CAST), where intact brains can be imaged at optical resolution without labeling by leveraging tissue clearing and the scattering contrast of optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI).",

CD47 is expressed at different levels by neoplastic and normal cells. Here, to reveal mechanisms by which different neoplastic cells generate this dominant ‘don’t eat me’ signal, we analyse the CD47 regulatory genomic landscape. We identify two distinct super-enhancers (SEs) associated with CD47 in certain cancer cell types. We show that a set of active constituent enhancers, located within the two CD47 SEs, regulate CD47 expression in different cancer cell types and that disruption of CD47 SEs reduces CD47 gene expression. Finally we report that the TNF-NFKB1 signalling pathway directly regulates CD47 by interacting with a constituent enhancer located within a CD47-associated SE specific to breast cancer. These results suggest that cancers can evolve SE to drive CD47 overexpression to escape immune surveillance.",

        "Abstrak": "We recently described an instability due to the nonlinear coupling of p-modes to g-modes and, as an application, we studied the stability of the tide in coalescing binary neutron stars. Although we found that the tide is p–g unstable early in the inspiral and rapidly drives modes to large energies, our analysis only accounted for three-mode interactions. Venumadhav et al. showed that four-mode interactions must also be accounted for as they enter into the analysis at the same order. They found a near-exact cancellation between three- and four-mode interactions and concluded that while the tide in binary neutron stars can be p–g unstable, the growth rates are not fast enough to impact the gravitational wave signal. Their analysis assumes that the linear tide is incompressible, which is true of the static linear tide (the m = 0 harmonic) but not the non-static linear tide (m = ±2). Here we account for the compressibility of the linear tide and find that three- and four-mode interactions no longer cancel. As a result, we find that the instability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies well before the binary merges. We also show that linear damping interferes with the cancellation and may further enhance the growth rates. The early onset of the instability (at gravitational wave frequencies ≈50 Hz) and the large number of rapidly growing modes suggest that the instability could impact the gravitational wave signal. Assessing its impact will require an understanding of how the instability saturates and is left to future work.",

        "Abstrak": "Architecture education, by being enclosed in studios and by focusing on formal qualities of spaces, has been detached from the direct experience of space and has prioritized vision over the other senses. If we are to extend our spatial understanding, we need to expand the boundaries of our sensory perception by developing tools and situated learning strategies focused on the interaction between our bodies and the built environment. I propose the Perceptual Prototypes as tools through which we can sense and experience space. My hypothesis is that the Perceptual Prototypes can augment our understanding of space by allowing us to focus on each of our senses individually. As precedents I discuss pedagogies of the Montessori method and the Bauhaus school, which focused on the separate training of the senses. I then draw upon studies in psychology and cognitive science to suggest that we can train our senses by 'sensing through' and 'experiencing through' the tools we use. To demonstrate the pedagogical implications of my thesis, I first discuss the procedure and results of the workshop 'Perception Creatures' I co-taught during IAP. Students designed their own 'creatures' using sensors to study the body-space interaction. I then proceed with an experiment where I ask participants to explore a physical space by using a wearable tool - the Perceptual Prototype - that I developed. In the experiment the tool takes again the role of a creature, which is limited to a specific sense. Asking participants to act as host for this creature, I study how they experience the space by focusing on each of the different senses. The results of the case studies demonstrate the enriched experiences and perceptions that emerge through the use of the Perceptual Prototypes suggesting a direction towards a sensory pedagogy of space through the use of tools as 'objects to sense with' in the learning process.",

Two component types, EPW1 & EPW2, can be adapted to create five different panel types. These units can be installed on the roof or vertical walls, and provide the innovative subject for evaluation within the framework. Four alternatives within two prototype homes, located in two climates, were analyzed to represent the existing and potential stock of housing and to provide the source of input data into the framework. An adaptable spreadsheet analysis, based on past and current analytical methods, establishes the EPW's potential benefit on the heating, cooling, electricity and total energy consumption loads within the prototype designs . Visualization models combined with physical models assess the aesthetics. The development of a Dynamic Process Model for Light Wood Framing (DPM-LWF) represents the framing construction process for the prototype designs, and provides time and cost impacts of the EPW alternatives. The. results from each analytical tool are combined to analyze the impacts of implementation, case results and sensitivities within the cases. A 'case result format' presents the results of the multiple alternatives for direct comparison, and can guide further investigations and information within the document. The EPW components demonstrated a 95% benefit for the electrical load of the \"Modern Design\" in Phoenix (currently), and the potential to reach over 100% benefit of the heating load in Boston for the \"Sears Design.\"",

Previous pool boiling studies have shown that nanofluids can improve critical heat flux (CHF) up to 200% for pool boiling and up to 50% for subcooled flow boiling due to the boiling induced nanoparticle deposition on the heated surface. Motivated by the significant CHF enhancement of nanoparticle deposited surface, this study investigated experimentally the subcooled flow boiling heat transfer of pre-coated test sections in water. Using a separate coating loop, stainless steel test sections were treated via flow boiling of alumina nanofluids at constant heat flux and mass flow rate. The pre-coated test sections were then used in another loop to measure subcooled flow boiling heat transfer coefficient and CHF with water. The CHF values for the pre-coated tubing were found on average to be 28% higher than bare tubing at high mass flux G = 2500 kg/m2 s. However, no enhancement was found at lower mass flux G = 1500 kg/m2 s. The heat transfer coefficients did not differ much between experiments when the bare or coated tubes were used. SEM images of the test sections confirm the presence of a nanoparticle coating layer. The nanoparticle deposition is sporadic and no relationship between the coating pattern and the amount of CHF enhancement is observed.",

By utilizing such aspects of lines and curves, together with the added capability of shape-change, new possibilities for display, interaction and body constraint are possible. In order to investigate these possibilities we have implemented two actuated curve interfaces at different scales.

To better understand the co-evolution of Cyanobacteria and other ancient anoxygenic phototrophic lineages with respect to geologic time, we designed and implemented a variety of molecular clocks that use horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as additional, relative constraints. These HGT constraints improve the precision of phototroph divergence date estimates and indicate that stem green non-sulfur bacteria are likely the oldest phototrophic lineage. Concurrently, crown Cyanobacteria age estimates ranged from 2.2 Ga to 2.7 Ga, with stem Cyanobacteria diverging ~2.8 Ga. These estimates provide a several hundred Ma window for oxygenic photosynthesis to evolve prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) ~2.3 Ga. In all models, crown green sulfur bacteria diversify after the loss of the banded iron formations from the sedimentary record (~1.8 Ga) and may indicate the expansion of the lineage into a new ecological niche following the GOE. Our date estimates also provide a timeline to investigate the temporal feasibility of different photosystem HGT events between phototrophic lineages. Using this approach, we infer that stem Cyanobacteria are unlikely to be the recipient of an HGT of photosystem I proteins from green sulfur bacteria but could still have been either the HGT donor or the recipient of photosystem II proteins with green non-sulfur bacteria, prior to the GOE. Together, these results indicate that HGT-constrained molecular clocks are useful tools for the evaluation of various geological and evolutionary hypotheses, using the evolutionary histories of both genes and organismal lineages.",

        "Abstrak": "The power density spectrum is an essential tool for determining the frequency content of X-ray radiation from astronomical sources. For neutron star systems, power density spectra reveal coherent oscillations for those sources that are pulsars, while quasi-periodic oscillations over a wide range of frequencies (0.01 to 1300 Hz) are used to identify subclasses and to probe the details of accretion physics. For black hole binaries, the power density spectrum is useful in many important contexts: distinguishing black hole binaries from neutron star binaries, tracking the evolution of X-ray states, and understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, in particular the high-frequency oscillations that appear to be rooted in general relativity for strong gravitational fields. However, measurements of the power density spectrum are modified by the effects of deadtime in X-ray detectors. In this work, we focus on the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) instrument of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), an orbiting observatory that offers fast, microsecond-level time resolution and modest spectral resolution for celestial X-ray sources. We derive a new model for the effect of detector deadtime on measurements of the power density spectrum.(cont.) The model treats in a unified manner the contributions from self-deadtime among selected events and interference from non-selected events. Using high-frequency power density spectra obtained from observations of X-ray sources, the new model is shown to be more accurate than existing approaches. The comparison between the model and the observations leads to a measurement of 8.83 s for the fundamental instrument deadtime timescale, which is dominated by the analog-to-digital conversion time. We additionally measure 59 jts and 137 /is for the Very Large Event deadtime related to observer-specified settings 1 and 2 respectively. Future refinements to the deadtimle model are discussed, such as corrections for highly variable sources and for individual X-ray energy bands.(cont.) A preliminary comparison between power density spectra from black hole binaries and neutron star binaries is undertaken using the new deadtime model. While it may be possible to use high-frequency cut-offs in the power continuum to distinguish neutron star binaries from black hole binaries in the thermal and hard X-ray states, the comparison is inconclusive for black hole binaries in the steep power-law state. Since state definitions require considerations of X-ray spectral properties, the comparison results dispute a suggestion in the literature that accreting neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished on the basis of power density spectra alone.",

Because only singlet spin states, statistically one quarter of the total possible states, emit fluorescent light, it has generally been thought that a maximum of 25% efficiency could be attained without the addition of an emissive phosphor. Here, we present evidence that this is not a fundamental limit. Two OLED structures have been studied, each providing evidence that the efficiency of the OLED can be enhanced by the use of a heavy-metal material to mix spin in charge-transfer states. A structure with a heavy-metal mixing layer placed beside a neat emissive layer was found to show a (2.5 ± 0.3) times enhancement in the efficiency compared with an OLED without the heavy-metal layer. However, differences in the electroluminescent emission spectra made attributing this result to spin statistics alone difficult. In a structure with the the heavy-metal mixing layer placed next to a fluorescent dye doped into a host, a (2.7 ± 0.2) times enhancement in the efficiency is measured.",

After constructing this laser, we measured an unsuitable experimental stability of 10 MHz over 5 minutes. A completely new monolithic laser system was built, providing better environmental isolation and a frequency stability of at least 1 MHz over 5 minutes. Using this laser, we were able to observe depletion and quantum jump effects in our ion trap system. Additionally, by scanning the red laser frequency, we were able to see the blue-laser broadened spectrum of the 674nm transition. Fitting the spectrum to a Voigt function yielded an ion temperature of 35 mK. To avoid blue-broadening, we set up blue and red laser pulse sequences.

Using optimized numerical methods, I present an analysis of the effect of 1-local and 2-local control error on the success of an adiabatic algorithm that solves the agree problem. Furthermore, I examine how the maximum allowable noise, or success threshold, scales with the number of qubits.

Although the turmoil of the 1997 Asian financial crisis slowed down economic growth the region is recovering gradually, and will need increasing energy supplies in the future. In the electricity sector, which has had to expand more slowly than it did in the 1980s, the main focus has been changing from how to satisfy the growing demand for high reliability to how to cut the cost of electricity. Under these circumstances, we examine the effective role of nuclear power, which can contribute to the stable supply of electricity and still meet the requirement of low emissions. A method of multi-attribute analysis is proposed to assess the feasibility of introducing nuclear power in combination with other generating facilities, such as natural gas, coal, oil and hydro. Capacity expansion plans from the year 2000 through 2020 in Japan Thailand, and Vietnam, which are composed by a technique of dynamic expansion planning, are evaluated on the basis of total costs, emissions, waste and energy security. In addition, the impact of electricity trade in Southeast Asia on the role of nuclear power is examined. This work concludes that nuclear power is compatible with the energy, economic and environmental conditions that may prevail in the region. The factors that promote nuclear power are: its low variable costs, the need for financial stability against unexpected economic disruptions of gas prices low interest rates to finance its capital needs and the limitation on CO2 emissions due to international concerns about global climate change.",

The goal is to produce pairs of photons which are not only polarization-entangled, but also have a high brightness within a narrow bandwidth. This novel source is more suitable than previous SPDC sources for transferring entanglement to future qubit storage such as a trapped rubidium memory. The narrow bandwidth is imposed by modifying the spectrum of the photon pairs by performing the down-conversion inside a cavity. The collinear downconversion geometry inside the linear cavity is achieved by using a quasi-phased-matched periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. The single-pass free-space photon-pairs produced were demonstrated to be polarization-entangled by measuring the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference dip and measuring a violation of Bell's inequality of 2.711 ± 0.010 (which was greater than the classical limit of 2). The cavity-enhanced downconversion was observed with a brightness of 0.7 pairs/s per mW of pump per MHz of bandwidth in the Gaussian mode collected (a generation rate of 110 pairs/s/mW/MHz is inferred). The interference dip from the pairs was measured to have a visibility of 75% when near the ideal equal-FSR operating point, where the pairs are in the biphoton triplet state. When detuned to have unequal FSR the output pairs show the an interference dip behavior consisting of a combination of triplet and singlet states that depends on the time separation of the pair as it leaves the cavity. The observed results corroborate detailed predictions of a Gaussian-state model of cavity-enhanced downconversion.",

However, the therapeutic effect of these drugs is dampened by elevated levels of the DNA repair enzyme, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which directly reverses this alkylation. As a result, assessing MGMT levels in patient samples provides an important predictor of therapeutic response; however, current methods available to measure this protein are indirect, complex and slow. Here we describe the design and synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors that report directly on MGMT activity in a single step within minutes. The chemosensors incorporate a fluorophore and quencher pair, which become separated by the MGMT dealkylation reaction, yielding light-up responses of up to 55-fold, directly reflecting repair activity. Experiments show that the best-performing probe retains near-native activity at mid-nanomolar concentrations. A nuclease-protected probe, NR-1, was prepared and tested in tumor cell lysates, demonstrating an ability to evaluate relative levels of MGMT repair activity in twenty minutes. In addition, a probe was employed to evaluate inhibitors of MGMT, suggesting utility for discovering new inhibitors in a high-throughput manner. Probe designs such as that of NR-1 may prove valuable to clinicians in selection of patients for alkylating drug therapies and in assessing resistance that arises during treatment.",

Little is known on the precise mechanism by which liver cells mediate recognition of gut microbes at steady state. Here we tested the hypothesis that a specific liver cell population was the sensor and we aimed at deciphering the mechanism by which the activation of TLR4 pathway would mediate liver response to gut microbiota.\r\nMethods\r\nUsing microarrays, we compared total liver gene expression in WT versus TLR4 deficient mice. We performed in situ localization of the major candidate protein, CXCL1. With an innovative technique based on cell sorting, we harvested enriched fractions of KCs, LSECs and HSCs from the same liver. The cytokine secretion profile was quantified in response to low levels of LPS (1ng/mL). Chemotactic activity of stellate cell-derived CXCL1 was assayed in vitro on neutrophils upon TLR4 activation.\r\nResults\r\nTLR4 deficient liver had reduced levels of one unique chemokine, CXCL1 and subsequent decreased of neutrophil counts. Depletion of gut microbiota mimicked TLR4 deficient phenotype, i.e., decreased neutrophils counts in the liver. All liver cells were responsive to low levels of LPS, but hepatic stellate cells were the major source of chemotactic levels of CXCL1. Neutrophil migration towards secretory hepatic stellate cells required the TLR4 dependent secretion of CXCL1.\r\nConclusions\r\nShowing the specific activation of TLR4 and the secretion of one major functional chemokine— CXCL1, the homolog of human IL-8-, we elucidate a new mechanism in which Hepatic Stellate Cells play a central role in the recognition of gut microbes by the liver at steady state.",

        "Abstrak": "As D A Schon describes the problem space is not given with the presentation of the design task, but constructed by the designer as he/she invents the moves by which he/she attempts to find solutions. From such a design process two episodes emerge, the first one comprised of all the moves a designer makes to construct and organize a problem space, and the second one describing how a designer might navigate through such a problem space in his/her attempt to arrive at solutions. It is the methods which designers use in these episodes which I define as 'design heuristics'. These can facilitate the early stages of the design process in several ways. First they can help set up a platform upon which designers can begin to operate, and which can become the catalyst for further development and refinement to occur. Secondly, they help introduce into the problem space any concerns the designer chooses to address, whether those emerge from site, climate, or other potential factors. These help to complement programmatic concerns, set up hierarchies, and subsequently help the designer determine the important aspects of the problem he/she is attempting to address. Thirdly, the introduction of different 'design heuristics' in both episodes of the design process helps to limit the range of possible solutions, and therefore eliminate the need for exhaustive search. In this thesis an iterative process of investigation is carried out in order to gain a better understanding into the nature of different 'design heuristics' and examine the potential for the development of a tool that can facilitate their implementation. Different categories of rules are introduced in an attempt to create an environment where deSign operations, independent of particular design problems, can be identified. Rules such as the grid, line, and boundary are implemented to investigate concepts of alignment, articulation, and envelope respectively. A random generator is used upon which these rules are superimposed, allowing for a better understanding of the potential and limitations of single rules, or combinations of them. The careful evaluation of a series of experimental products gave rise to a series of concepts that could be critical in the development of an appropriate tool offering more insight as to how one should proceed next. Introducing 'flexibility' for each one of these rules allowed for the development of hierarchies of importance among the different heuristics a deSigner might choose to apply. 'Directional constraints' for each of the rules emerged as critical allowing the development of different variants from each one of the rules described above. The grid for example could have different constrains in anyone of its three axis. The 'sequence' by which these rules are applied emerged as important in the articulation of each one of these rules. The rule applied first would have to compromise the most following the application of subsequent rules. The careful study of products utilizing different variations of such concepts gave better insight as to how these concepts might be further developed and also allowed for new ones to emerge. Furthermore an attempt is made to address both episodes described above by defining a stage of 'generation' followed by a stage of 'post-generation control'. A collection of such concepts can begin to clarify some of the operations that are part of the design activity, setting up the ground for the development of a design tool that facilitates the application of heuristics in the early stages of the design process.",

        "Abstrak": "This thesis presents three studies of warm (photoionized) absorber variability in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using high-resolution X-ray spectra provided by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG). The first study is a single observation of the AGN MR 2251-178, which is known to have a highly variable warm absorber (WA). We find an unusually thin effective hydrogen column density along the line of sight compared to previous observations. Strong line emission without corresponding absorption indicates significant WA geometric structure. Strong absorption features in the spectrum are evidence of a highly-ionized, high-velocity outflow, which could be carrying a large amount of mass and energy out of the AGN. In the second study, we search for absorption lines variability in the well-studied WA of MCG -6-30-15. We find a significant anti-correlation over time between at least two ions, with suggestions of additional time variation in other ions. At least one line, the is - 2p resonance line of Mg XII, varies as a function of 2-10 keV continuum luminosity. Luminosity-driven ionization changes alone are insufficient to explain the observed variation.(cont.) Either multiple factors influence line strength on observable time scales, or the line of sight to the central source varies over time through a structured absorber. In the third study, we survey spectra from the HETG data archive. We model the normalized excess variance (NEV) spectrum of a varying WA and find that it does not explain high-energy (> 2 keV) spectral variation, nor does it generally fit NEV spectra at lower energies (< 2 keV). We also search through each spectrum at high resolution (AA = 0.01 A) for bins which vary more than expected due to normal Poissonian fluctuations. We find some evidence for such variation in the aggregate sample, though not in AGN individually. Our results show that WA structure is more complicated than pictured in contemporary models. Future high-resolution spectroscopic variability studies are certainly warranted. AGN models should eventually consider the effects of WA structure and the influence of continuum variation on the WA.",

        "Abstrak": "In scenarios that stabilize the electroweak scale, the top quark is typically accompanied by partner particles. In this work, we demonstrate how extended stabilizing symmetries can yield scalar or fermionic top partners that transform as ordinary color triplets but carry exotic electric charges. We refer to these scenarios as “hypertwisted” since they involve modifications to hypercharge in the top sector. As proofs of principle, we construct two hypertwisted scenarios: a supersymmetric construction with spin-0 top partners, and a composite Higgs construction with spin-1/2 top partners. In both cases, the top partners are still phenomenologically compatible with the mass range motivated by weak-scale naturalness. The phenomenology of hypertwisted scenarios is diverse, since the lifetimes and decay modes of the top partners are model dependent. The novel coupling structure opens up search channels that do not typically arise in top-partner scenarios, such as pair production of top-plus-jet resonances. Furthermore, hypertwisted top partners are typically sufficiently long lived to form “top-partnerium” bound states that decay predominantly via annihilation, motivating searches for rare narrow resonances with diboson decay modes.",

Marketers often have access to data on interactions among customers from which, with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting activities.",

As a result, many widely used data processing systems fall well short of peak hardware performance. We have developed Weld, an intermediate language and runtime that can run data-parallel computations efficiently on modern hardware. The core of Weld is a novel intermediate language (IL) that is expressive enough to capture common data-parallel applications (e.g., SQL, graph analytics and machine learning) while being easy to parallelize on modern hardware, through the use of a simple \"parallel builder\" abstraction and nested parallel loops. Weld supports complex optimizations like vectorization and loop blocking, as well as a multicore CPU backend. Finally,Weld's runtime can to optimize across library functions used in the same program, enabling further speedups that are not possible with today's disjoint libraries. In this thesis, we describe the Weld IL and then turn to the multicore CPU backend, providing a theoretical analysis suggesting that it has low overheads and showing that microbenchmarks and real-word applications like TensorFlow have excellent multicore performance when ported to run on Weld.",

An important class of problems where quantum computers possess an advantage is phase estimation, which includes applications like factoring. We introduce a computational model based on a single squeezed state resource that can perform phase estimation, which we call the power of one qumode. This model is inspired by an interesting computational model known as deterministic quantum computing with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using the power of one qumode, we identify that the amount of squeezing is sufficient to quantify the resource requirements of different computational problems based on phase estimation. In particular, we can use the amount of squeezing to quantitatively relate the resource requirements of DQC1 and factoring. Furthermore, we can connect the squeezing to other known resources like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality, and qubit number. We show the circumstances under which they can likewise be considered good resources.",

        "Abstrak": "Although the use of Aluminum in cars has been increasing for the past two decades, there has been limited progress in the development of aluminum auto bodies. Although some carmakers have developed all aluminum spaceframe designs, aluminum is far from being a material of choice for autobodies. Most aluminum substitution has come in the form of castings and forgings in the transmission, wheels etc. The substitution of steel by aluminum is partly influenced by the regulatory pressures to meet fuel efficiency standards by lightweighting and recycling standards. The thesis looks at the possible reasons-both regulatory pressures and market forces as to why aluminum has been a part by part substitute for steel rather than for the entire autobody. The key obstacle is the high cost of primary aluminum as compared to steel. Both the aluminum and the automotive industries have made attempts in their respective areas to make aluminum a cost-effective alternative to steel. The thesis looks at the possible options for the aluminum industry in the current macroeconomic conditions including scale economies and cost analysis of newer rolling technologies. The thesis then analyzes the cost of fabrication and assembly of four different aluminum car body designs compared with the conventional steel designs. The cost of the car design depends on the how cost effective that the aluminum producers can be in producing the primary aluminum. We then attempt to analyze if the aluminum can be an alternative to steel at lower primary aluminum prices, if these can be feasible and the possible implications for the aluminum producers and the regulators.",

        "Abstrak": "\"Systems\" goods-such as computers, telecom networks, and automobiles-are made up of multiple components. This dissertation comprises three essays that study the decisions of system innovators in mobile computing to \"open\" development of their systems to outside suppliers and the implications of doing so. The first essay considers this issue from the perspective of which components are retained under the control of the original innovator to act as a \"platform\" in the system. Based on detailed review of leading systems in this industry in data spanning 1984-2004, I find that platform boundaries expand and contract over time as a means for platform suppliers to promote the adoption of the platform (by end-customers, downstream manufacturers, and suppliers of complements) and simultaneously to ensure the continuing innovation of the system. The second essay provides a systematic empirical investigation of how the extent of openness chosen by the platform supplier affected the rate of innovation of mobile computing devices. I measure openness in relation to both the boundaries of the platform and the extent to which actions were taken by platform suppliers to promote entry by hardware device manufacturers.(cont.) I find regular relationships across multiple measures of innovation that suggest that the whether openness increases or decreases innovation depends on the nature of innovation and the intensity of competition between device makers. The third essay moves from device hardware to the applications software developer networks that form around opened platforms. I investigate the effect of platform suppliers' aggressive promotion of entry of software developers around their platforms. I find that while large developer networks are associated with a wide selection of software titles, that very large developer networks in fact lead to less software output. I interpret this result as revealing the importance of maintaining investment incentives-even in a context with network effects.",

The model provides an alternative explanation for the anomaly of a price gap between two fundamentally identical securities. Strategic arbitrageurs, taking into account their price impact, do not close the price gap. This gap makes investors who trade with the strategic arbitrageur less willing to invest in risky assets ex ante. Thus, the gap brings an additional source of risk, anticipation risk. The model predicts that the future price gap is wide when the current trading volume is high. Daily data for Royal Dutch and Shell provides evidence in support of the model. Chapter 2 (coauthored with Joon Chae and Andrew W. Lo) is about stock price behavior. We perform various statistical analyses on stock market returns as Fama (1965) did, using CRSP index returns from 1926-2005. We investigate stock return distributions and report return characteristics. First, stock returns do not follow a normal distribution, though many studies assume this.(cont.) Second, autocorrelations of stock returns are not zero (as verified by many predictability studies). In addition, the level of autocorrelations varies widely across time. Third, there is little evidence for long term memory and cyclic behavior. Finally, several stock market anomalies, including January effect, weekday effect, turn-of-the-month effect and turn-of-the-quarter effect, are still significant after many years of their discoveries. Chapter 3 studies the statistics of Sharpe ratio differences. We derive the statistical distributions of the Sharpe ratio differences using standard asymptotic theory under three sets of assumptions for the return-generating process - independently and identically distributed returns, stationary returns, and with time aggregation. We compare the hedge fund Sharpe ratios and find that the Sharpe ratio differences are not statistically different from zero.",

Motivated by the recent interest in trapped photoelectrons measured by the Van Allen Probes in the radiation belts, we calculate the extent of the trapped photoelectron area and the potential barrier as a function of the dipole strength and sun angle using the monopole- dipole model. We find that the dipole strength is an important parameter in controlling the behavior of the potential wells and barriers. The usual inequality, 1/2 ≤ A ≤ 1 where A is the dipole strength, used in the monopole-dipole model can be relaxed and amended for finite sun angles. We then use a simple method to estimate the density of the trapped low-energy electrons in these areas.

A Verma module may admit an invariant Hermitian form, which is unique up to multiplication by a real scalar when it exists. Suitably normalized, it is known as the Shapovalov form. The collection of highest weights decomposes under the affine Weyl group action into alcoves.

Porras and Cirac's work has shown that off-resonance laser light couples the internal states of the trapped ions with their external motional states; the external states of the ions are coupled through their Coulomb repulsion. Therefore the internal states of ions can be mapped to effective spin states and spin coupling is mediated by phonons. I propose two simulation schemes for quantum spin Hamiltonians in two dimensions: the time evolution of a spin state in a system of three ions with ferromagnetic interaction and spin frustration in a triangle. To realize these proposals, I design and microfabricate a hexagonal lattice trap and install it into an ultrahigh vacuum chamber.

(The five properties are the jet quenching parameter, the velocity dependence of screening, and the drag and transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients for a heavy quark pulled through the plasma.) We do so using a toy model in which nonconformality is introduced via a one-parameter deformation of the AdS black hole dual to the hot KN = 4 SYM plasma. For values of this parameter which correspond to a degree of nonconformality comparable to that seen in lattice calculations of QCD thermodynamics at temperatures a few times that of the crossover to quark-gluon plasma, we find that the jet quenching parameter is affected by the nonconformality at the 30% level or less, the screening length is affected at the 20% level or less, but the drag and diffusion coefficients for a slowly moving heavy quark can be modified by as much as 80%. However, we show that all but one of the five properties that we investigate become completely insensitive to the nonconformality in the high velocity limit v --, 1. The exception is the jet quenching parameter, which is unique among the quantities that we investigate in being \"infrared sensitive\" even at v = 1, where it is defined. That is, it is the only high-velocity observable that we investigate which is sensitive to properties of the medium at infrared energy scales proportional to T, namely the scales where the quark-gluon plasma of QCD can be strongly coupled. The other four quantities all probe only scales that are larger than T by a factor that diverges as v -- 1, namely scales where the KN = 4 SYM plasma can be strongly coupled but the quark-gluon plasma of QCD is not.",

In this thesis, we study polyhedral and combinatorial properties of a variant we call the Traveling Salesman Walk Problem, in which the minimum cost walk from the source to destination visits all cities at least once. Using the approach of linear programming, we study properties of the polyhedron corresponding to a linear programming relaxation of the traveling salesman walk problem. Our results relate the structure of the underlying graph of the problem instance with polyhedral properties of the corresponding fractional walk polyhedron. We first characterize traveling salesman walk perfect graphs, graphs for which the convex hull of incidence vectors of traveling salesman walks can be described by linear inequalities. We show these graphs have a description by way of forbidden minors and also characterize them constructively.(cont.) We extend these results to relate the underlying graph structure to the integrality gap of the corresponding fractional walk polyhedron. We present several graph operations which preserve integrality gap; these operations allow us to find the integrality gap of graphs built from smaller bricks, whose integrality gaps can be found by computational or other methods.",

        "Abstrak": "Highway systems have witnessed a significant modernization in recent years due to the deployment of traffic sensing and control capabilities. In addition, the ongoing developments in connected and autonomous vehicle technology are poised to enable advanced capabilities such as platooning and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. On one hand, these advancements offer new opportunities for improving the operational efficiency of highway systems. On the other hand, most highway system operators still face significant challenges in ensuring adequate performance under disruptions such as incidents and other capacity-reducing events, as well as demand fluctuations. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities of cyber-physical components in smart highway systems are prone to exploitation by adversarial agents, who can introduce strategic disruptions. Thus, ensuring the resiliency of highway operations is a principal concern of system operators. In this thesis, we contribute to the above-mentioned challenge by developing a system-theoretic approach for maintaining resilient highway operations under a broad range of disruptions, modeled as stochastic perturbations in highway capacity or traffic demand. In particular, we focus on three types of highway operations: vehicle platooning, ramp metering, and capacity-aware routing/demand management. Our approach relies on (i) modeling partially automated traffic flow dynamics under disruptions as stochastically switching dynamical systems, (ii) analyzing their long-time properties (stability and/or convergence), and (iii) designing traffic control schemes that improve system throughput with stability guarantees. We demonstrate the application of our approach to several realistic situations ranging from capacity perturbations at incident hotspots to moving bottlenecks created by heavy-duty vehicles to stochastic arrivals/progression of autonomous vehicle platoons. To model traffic flow dynamics under disruptions, we extend classical macroscopic traffic flow/queuing models by combining them with Markovian switches in flow/queuing dynamics that capture the stochasticity in occurrence/clearance of disruptions. Specifically, we propose two models: Piecewise-Deterministic Queuing (PDQ) model, and Stochastic Switching Cell Transmission Model (SS-CTM). The PDQ model is the most basic model that captures the dynamic evolution of a traffic queue upstream of a highway bottleneck under perturbations in capacity or demand. We use this model to analyze link-level capacity management schemes and design capacity-aware routing schemes for parallel-route highway systems. The SS-CTM captures the spatial propagation of a disturbance created by capacity perturbations, and is useful for identifying the congestion bottlenecks induced by these perturbations. We adopt this model to analyze the impact of perturbations on the on-ramp queues and highway throughput as well as to design new ramp control schemes with improved performance guarantees. Our results on the stability analysis of PDQ and SS-CTM utilize more general results on the stability of continuous-time Markov processes. We refine them for the purpose of evaluating the boundedness of traffic queues upstream of highway bottlenecks and on the ramps. Our key contribution is a computationally tractable approach for verifying the classical Foster-Lyapunov drift condition over a finite subset of states, which happen to be the vertices of an invariant set for the stochastic traffic dynamics. This requires us to exploit the long-time properties of the PDQ and SS-CTM-in particular, the cooperativity of traffic flow dynamics and ergodicity of Markov chain that models disruptions. Our analysis approach enables us to estimate how performance metrics such as throughput and travel time change with location and intensity (rate) of disruptions. We also extend our results to the problem of designing traffic control schemes that improve system throughput under perturbations, while maintaining stable traffic queues. This leads us to identify somewhat surprising ways to prioritize and route traffic on real-world highway systems, and relate them to important operational capabilities such as lane control on automated highways, speed regulation of platoons, incident-aware routing, and stabilization of on-ramp queues. Finally, we also consider the modeling and impact evaluation of security disruptions. We report an initial game-theoretic model that captures an emerging security concern in multi-priority highway systems. The model is relevant to study the incentives of strategic misbehavior by individual vehicles who can exploit the security vulnerabilities in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications and impact the highway operations. We also discuss strategic response to cyber-physical attacks on smart highway infrastructure for timely recovery of compromised traffic links.",

        "Abstrak": "Monte Carlo (MC) neutral particle transport methods have long been considered the gold-standard for nuclear simulations, but high computational cost has limited their use significantly. However, as we move towards higher-fidelity nuclear reactor analyses the method has become competitive with traditional deterministic transport algorithms for the same level of accuracy, especially considering the inherent parallelism of the method and the ever-increasing concurrency of modern high performance computers. Yet before such analysis can be practical, several algorithmic challenges must be addressed, particularly in regards to the memory requirements of the method. In this thesis, a robust domain decomposition algorithm is proposed to alleviate this, along with models and analysis to support its use for full-scale reactor analysis. Algorithms were implemented in the full-physics Monte Carlo code OpenMC, and tested for a highly-detailed PWR benchmark: BEAVRS. The proposed domain decomposition implementation incorporates efficient algorithms for scalable inter-domain particle communication in a manner that is reproducible with any pseudo-random number seed. Algorithms are also proposed to scalably manage material and tally data with on-the-fly allocation during simulation, along with numerous optimizations required for scalability as the domain mesh is refined and divided among thousands of compute processes. The algorithms were tested on two supercomputers, namely the Mira Blue Gene/Q and the Titan XK7, demonstrating good performance with realistic tallies and materials requiring over a terabyte of aggregate memory. Performance models were also developed to more accurately predict the network and load imbalance penalties that arise from communicating particles between distributed compute nodes tracking different spatial domains. These were evaluated using machine properties and tallied particle movement characteristics, and empirically validated with observed timing results from the new implementation. Network penalties were shown to be almost negligible with per-process particle counts as low as 1000, and load imbalance penalties higher than a factor of four were not observed or predicted for finer domain meshes relevant to reactor analysis. Load balancing strategies were also explored, and intra-domain replication was shown to be very effective at improving parallel efficiencies without adding significant complexity to the algorithm or burden to the user. Performance of the strategy was quantified with a performance model, and shown to agree well with observed timings. Imbalances were shown to be almost completely removed for the finest domain meshes. Finally, full-core studies were carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of domain-decomposed Monte Carlo in tackling the full scope of the problem. A detailed mesh required for a robust depletion treatment was used, and good performance was demonstrated for depletion tallies with 206 nuclides. The largest runs scored six reaction rates for each nuclide in 51M regions for a total aggregate memory requirement of 1.4TB, and particle tracking rates were consistent with those observed for smaller non-domain- decomposed runs with equivalent tally complexity. These types of runs were previously not achievable with traditional Monte Carlo methods, and can be accomplished with domain decomposition with between 1.4x and 1.75x overhead with simple load balancing.",

        "Abstrak": "Although the mechanics of bone has been studied extensively at the micro- and macro-scale, the nano-scopic level is perhaps the most illuminating as this is the length scale at which the individual constituents interact. Bone is made primarily up of type I collagen, hydroxyapatite mineral, a variety of non-collagenous proteins, and water. A multitechnique experimental and modeling approach methodology was used break down several of the deformation mechanisms that exist in bone at the nanoscale including the effect of mineral content, cohesive-frictional plasticity, increased ductility through mechanical heterogeneity, and intermolecular forces. To show that mineral content had a significant effect on both nanomechanical properties and ultrastructural deformation mechanisms of bone, partial and complete demineralization was carried out to produce samples ranging from -0-58 wt.% mineral content. Nanoindentation experiments perpendicular to the osteonal axis found a 4-6x increase in stiffness for the -58 wt.% sample compared to the completely demineralized -~0 wt.% samples. These results are discussed in the context of in situ and post-mortem AFM imaging studies which shed light on nanoscale mechanisms of deformation including collagen fibril deformation and pressure induced structural transitions of the mineral component.(cont.) A finite element elastic-plastic continuum model was able to predict the nanomechanical properties of the different samples on loading and unloading. In addition, the ultrastructural origins of the strength of bone, which is critical for proper physiological function, were also investigated. A combination of dual nanoindentation, 3-D elastic-plastic FEA using a Mohr-Coulomb cohesive-frictional strength criterion, and angle of repose measurements was employed, suggesting that nanogranular friction is responsible for increased resistance to plasticity in compression, and that cohesion originates from within the organic matrix itself, rather than organic-mineral bonding. Nanomechanical heterogeneity is also expected to influence elasticity, damage, fracture, and remodeling of bone. The spatial distribution of nanomechanical properties of bone was quantified for the first time at the length scale of individual collagen fibrils. The results show elaborate patterns of stiffness ranging from 2 to 35 GPa which do not correlate directly with topographical features and hence, are attributed to underlying local structural variations. A new energy dissipation mechanism is proposed arising from nanomechanical heterogeneity, offering a graceful means for ductility enhancement, damage evolution, and toughening.(cont.) This hypothesis is supported by finite element simulations which incorporate the nanoscale experimental data and predict markedly different biomechanical properties compared to a uniform material, through nonuniform inelastic deformation over larger areas and increased energy dissipation. The fundamental concepts discovered here are applicable to a broad class of biological materials and may serve as a design consideration for biologically-inspired materials technologies. Stem cell-based gene therapy and tissue engineering have been shown to be an efficient method for the regeneration of critical-size bone defects. Despite being an area of active research over the last decade, no previous knowledge of the intrinsic structural and nanomechanical properties of such bone tissue exists. The nanomechanical properties of engineered bone tissue derived from genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing the rhBMP2 gene, grown in vivo in an ectopic as well as a radial defect site of immunocompetent mice is compared to native bone adjacent to the transplantation sites. Supplementary experiments showed that the two types of bone had similar mineral contents, overall microstructures showing lacunae and canaliculi, chemical compositions, and nanoscale topographical morphologies.(cont.) Nanoindentation experiments revealed that the small length scale mechanical properties were statistically different for the engineered bone derived from the ectopically implanted site. For data derived from the radial defect site experiments, results were both statistically similar and different, depending on the particular animal. The intermolecular forces (i.e. electrostatics, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, etc.) that exist in bone are also expected to play a significant role in determining its morphology, structural integrity, interaction with bone fluid and its constituent biomolecular species as well as synthetic bone implant materials. Understanding of the macromolecular mechanisms of biomineralization in bone is an area of significant interest that is widely applicable to a wide range of materials applications, both biological in origin and synthetic. High resolution force spectroscopy (HRFS) allows for direct measurement of forces between a nanosized probe tip functionalized with SAMs which are molecules of uniform structure, charge, and chemistry as a function of separation distance from the sample in fluid. This data on approach was compared to electrostatic double layer theory, and the surface charge density (a) was estimated numerically. The normal electrostatic double layer forces were measured for the first time between a SAM functionalized probe tip and bone of varying mineral content.",

The goal of the project was to reduce inventory by applying a pull ordering system to the distributor's value chain. The thesis provides background on the theory of \"push\" vs. \"pull\" systems, and a discussion of how pull systems can reduce inventory while maintaining or improving service level. Typically, pull systems are applied to situations of relatively frequent and constant demand. Using a model developed for the internship company, we demonstrate that a two-bin kanban refill system can be applied to reduce inventory by 50-60%, even given a situation of volatile demand. We describe the pilot project (currently in progress) intended to prove out the kanban system's performance, including the team composition, implementation plan, and perceived barriers to implementation. In conclusion, we reflect on the project's results and present suggestions for future improvement.",

        "Abstrak": "After the market boom of 2000 in the semiconductor industry changed significantly. The changes included stricter limits on capital cost spending, and the increased propensity of the industry to outsource the manufacturing of semiconductors. Thus, the semiconductor industry demanded greater cost of test economics in semiconductor test equipment. In response to the changes in the industry and the customer demands, the semiconductor test industry segmented itself into two broad strategies. Typically, the large semiconductor test equipment manufacturers employed a broad platform strategy, while the smaller semiconductor test equipment manufacturers employed a niche platform strategy. This thesis confirms the underlying changes in the semiconductor test industry by looking at the entire semiconductor value chain. It also looks at the root causes of the changes in order to determine the future effects of the changes in the semiconductor test industry. This thesis also analyzes the two distinct market strategies, developing a systematic method to compare and evaluate each strategy. In addition, it explores the intangible risks associated with the adoption of each strategy. After understanding the trends in the semiconductor test industry, this thesis also presents a unified model to discuss the future direction of the semiconductor test industry. Looking at this direction, this project develops specific recommendations for businesses to compete effectively given the impending market conditions.",

        "Abstrak": "Cartilage, particularly its collagen network, has been suggested by many to be fatigue prone, but the mechanism via which fatigue damage occurs is not yet well-understood. This work seeks to provide a simple framework to further our understanding of the degeneration of this tissue a result of fatigue damage via experimentation and analytical modeling. It was as observed that subjecting initially intact bovine tibial plateau cartilage to repeated long-term applications of an indentation loading protocol, which does not induce any observable damage over a single short-term application, can result in surface damage. The damage can be associated with an increase in the GAG release and decrease in the tissue nominal equilibrium modulus. The ability of the tissue to regain its original configuration also deteriorated with increasing number of loading cycles, but the change was generally gradual. Changes in the optimized parameters obtained from fitting a 1-D rheological model to both the relaxation and cyclic loading responses of cartilage in the undamaged and damaged states suggested that both GAG and collagen have been weakened as a result of damage. A portfolio of data describing the 3-D mechanical behavior of calf tibial plateau cartilage was obtained in this work. It was found that both the axial and lateral responses of cartilage were nonlinear during stress relaxation. Also, the resistance of the tissue to shear and volumetric deformation is dissipative, with the same time constants.(cont.) Finally, differences in the extra- and sub-meniscal tissue were noted. A structurally-based constitutive model that was originally formulated for cervical stroma was employed in this work in attempt to capture the mechanical response of cartilage. It was found able to capture the axial and lateral responses of cartilage in unconfined compression at 20% nominal strain. Changes in the material parameters obtained from fitting the constitutive model to the indentation responses of cartilage in the native and damaged states suggested that damage has induced alterations in both GAG and collagen, echoing our earlier findings.",

A ZnlITe ambipolar electrolysis cell comprising ZnTe dissolved in molten ZnCl 2 at 500 0C was first investigated by two- and three-electrode electrochemical analysis techniques. The electrochemical behavior of the melt, thermodynamic properties, and kinetic properties were evaluated. A single cell battery was constructed, demonstrating for the first time the simultaneous extraction of two different liquid metals onto electrodes of opposite polarity. Although a low open circuit voltage and high material costs make this approach unsuitable for the intended application, it was found that this electrochemical phenomenon could be utilized in a new recycling process for bimetallic semiconductors. A second type of liquid metal battery was investigated that utilized the potential difference generated by metal alloys of different compositions. MgjlSb cells of this nature were operated at 700 °C, demonstrating that liquid Sb can serve as a positive electrode. Ca,MgIIBi cells also of this nature were studied and a Ca,Mg liquid alloy was successfully used as the negative electrode, permitting the use of Ca as the electroactive species. Thermodynamic and battery performance results suggest that Ca,MgIISb cells have the potential to achieve a sufficient cell voltage, utilize earth abundant materials, and meet the demanding cost and cycle-life requirements for use in grid-scale energy storage applications.",

        "Abstrak": "The blood clotting process is one of the human body's masterpieces in targeted molecular manipulation, as it requires the activation of the clotting cascade at a specific place and a specific time. Recent research in the biological sciences have discovered that one of the protein molecules involved in the initial stages of the clotting response, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), exhibits counterintuitive and technologically useful properties that are driven in part by the physical environment in the bloodstream at the site of a wound. In this thesis, we take inspiration from initial observations of the vWF in experiments, and aim to describe the behaviors observed in this process within the context of polymer physics. By understanding these physical principles, we hope to harness nature's ability to both direct molecules in both spatial and conformational coordinates. This thesis is presented in three complementary sections. After an initial introduction describing the systems of interest, we first describe the behavior of collapsed Lennard-Jones polymers in the presence of an infinite medium. It has been shown that simple bead-spring homopolymer models describe vWF quite well in vitro. We build upon this previous work to first describe the behavior of a collapsed homopolymer in an elongational fluid flow. Through a nucleation-protrusion mechanism, scaling relationships can be developed to provide a clear picture of a first-order globule-stretch transition and its ramifications in dilute-solution rheology. The implications of this behavior and its relation to the current literature provides qualitative explanations for the physiological process of vasoconstriction. In an effort to generalize these observations, we present an entire theory on the behavior of polymer globules under influence of any local fluid flow. Finally, we investigate the internal dynamics of these globules by probing their pulling response in an analogous fashion to force spectroscopy. We elucidate the presence of both a solid-liquid dynamic globule transition and a contour-based description of internal globule friction. It is possible to incrementally add levels of details to these Lennard-Jones polymer models to more accurately represent biological molecules. In the second section of this thesis, we investigate the consequences of incorporating a Bell-model behavior into single homopolymer interactions to describe a \"self-associating\" polymer. We first demonstrate how this model is, in equilibrium, essentially the same as a Lennard-Jones polymer, however we demonstrate that the polymer dynamics are indeed both drastically different and tunable. This has ramifications under the presence of dynamic loads, and we investigate single-molecule response to both shear and pulling stimuli. In the former, we find novel and tunable giant non-monotonic stretching responses. In the latter, we use our observations to develop a complete and general theory of pulling these types of molecules that has ramifications in both the study of biological polymers and in the design of soft materials with tunable mechanical response. The final section introduces concepts related to the behavior of collapsed polymers in fluid flows near surfaces. During the blood clotting process, vWF undergoes a counterintuitive adsorption process and here we begin to develop the physical fundamentals required to understand this process. After a brief introduction to the relevant hydrodynamic treatment we use in simulations, we first describe the presence of a hydrodynamic lift force and the formalism we use as we include it in the context of our theory. We reveal the presence of a non-monotonic lift force, and subsequently utilize this theoretical formalism to describe the adsorption and desorption behavior of a collapsed polymer globule near an attractive surface. We investigate the limit of large flows and highly attractive surfaces by providing a description of the conformational and hydrodynamic behavior of a polymer tethered at a surface. We finally discuss the behaviors of a polymer that associates with a surface, and postulate the importance of such processes in vWF function. We finally include an addendum that describes an unrelated project that investigates the possibilities of using superparamagnetic beads as a tool for hydrodynamic propulsion by assembling these beads into \"rotors\" near a surface to create micro-walkers that have interesting applications in self-assembled microfluidic chips.",

Bruner, B. Dalie, and M. L. Harter, Science 237:1044-1046, 1987). In this study, we show that\r\nthis protein is also capable of transactivating in vitro the adenovirus virus-associated (VA1) RNA gene\r\ntranscribed by RNA polymerase UI. Pertinent to the transcription of this gene is the rate-limiting component,\r\nTFIIIC, which appears to be of two distinct forms in uninfected HeLa cells. The addition of an oligonucleotide\r\ncontaining a TFIIIC binding site to HeLa whole-cell extracts inhibits VAT transcription by sequestering\r\nTFIIIC. However, the addition of purified ETA to extracts previously challenged with the TFIIIC oligonucleotide\r\nrestores the level of VAT transcription. When included in the same reaction, an ElA-specific monoclonal\r\nantibody reverses the restoration. Incubation of purified ETA with either HeLa cell nuclear or whole-cell\r\nextracts alters the DNA-binding properties of TFIIIC as detected by gel shift assays. This alteration does not\r\noccur if ElA-specific antibody and ETA protein are added simultaneously to the extract. In contrast, the\r\naddition of this antibody to extracts at a later time does not reverse the alteration observed in the TFIIIC\r\nbinding activities. Never at any time did we note the formation of novel TFIIIC-promoter complexes after the\r\naddition of ETA to nuclear extracts. These results clearly establish that ETA mediates its effect on VAT\r\ntranscription through TFIIIC in a very rapid yet indirect manner. The results also establish that a bacterially\r\nproduced ETA protein can directly participate in RNA polymerase II transcription without the requirement of\r\nceliular protein synthesis or other viral proteins.",

Strains occur in different parts of the hamstring muscle but very little is known about whether common hamstring loading exercises specifically load different hamstring components. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle activation of different components of the hamstring muscle during common hamstring loading exercises.\r\nMethods:\r\nTwenty elite female track and field athletes were recruited into this study, which had a single-sample, repeated-measures design. Each athlete performed ten hamstring loading exercises, and an electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from the biceps femoris and semitendinosus components of the hamstring. Hamstring EMG during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was used to normalize the mean data across ten repetitions of each exercise. An electrogoniometer synchronized to the EMG was used to determine whether peak EMG activity occurred during muscle-tendon unit lengthening, shortening, or no change in length. Mean EMG values were compared between the two recording sites for each exercise using the Student’s t-test.\r\nResults:\r\nThe lunge, dead lift, and kettle swings were low intensity (<50% MVIC) and all showed higher EMG activity for semitendinosus than for biceps femoris. Bridge was low but approaching medium intensity, and the TRX, hamstring bridge, and hamstring curl were all medium intensity exercises (≥50% or <80% MVIC). The Nordic, fitball, and slide leg exercises were all high intensity exercises. Only the fitball exercise showed higher EMG activity in the biceps femoris compared with the semitendinosus. Only lunge and kettle swings showed peak EMG in the muscle-tendon unit lengthening phase and both these exercises involved faster speed.\r\nConclusion:\r\nSome exercises selectively activated the lateral and medial distal hamstrings. Low, medium, and high intensity exercises were demonstrated. This information enables the clinician, strength and conditioning coach and physiotherapist to better understand intensity- and muscle-specific activation during hamstring muscle rehabilitation. Therefore, these results may help in designing progressive strengthening and rehabilitation and prevention programs.",

It first started at Raytheon's Andover manufacturing facility in early 2000 with the strategic objectives of linking Lean and Six Sigma behavior to customers' successes and gradually transforming Raytheon into a Lean workplace. VBS dashboards are projected onto flat screen panels located throughout the factory floor such that anyone on the floor can view the production line status in real-time. This thesis focuses on developing a new VBS dashboard and using it to transform the enterprise. Leveraging the success in manufacturing deployment, this thesis describes Raytheon's initial attempt of extending VBS to the engineering arena, with the goals of driving Lean and Six Sigma behavior to the next level, transforming problem solving behavior from reactive to proactive and from containment to prevention, redefining quality control and performance metrics to better reveal business risks and opportunities and eliminating undesirable aspects in cost, cycle time and information latency. The VBS dashboard described in this thesis provides root cause \"drill-down\" capabilities for quality control and performance assessment, which leads to cycle time reduction, early stage problem resolution and defect prevention. VBS changes data ownership culture from privatize to publicize, which couples employees' actions to responsibilities and enhances proactive problem solving attitude. VBS dashboard is also a one-stop shop for data collection and analysis, which eliminates non-value added work for processing and fetching data from multiple sources. Last but not least, VBS dashboards build on modular development architecture, which enables quick turnaround on deliverables.(cont.) Therefore, VBS is considered the \"disruptive technology\" of many existing corporate information technology systems and the Andon boards.",

        "Abstrak": "Programmed cell death is an important process regulating cell number in the development of all animals. Two genes, ces-1 and ces-2 control programmed cell death in a subset of developing neurons in C. elegans. To understand how ces-1 and ces-2 might act to regulate programmed cell death, we have cloned these genes. We find that both ces-1 and ces-2 encode transcription factors. By sequence and DNA-binding specificity CES-1 is a member of the Snail family of zinc-finger proteins, and most similar to the Drosophila protein Scratch. CES-2 is a bZIP protein closest in sequence and DNA-binding specificity to members of the vertebrate PAR subfamily. We have analyzed ces-1 regulation and, by conservation in the related nematode C. briggsae and by the position of the ces-1 gain-of-function mutations, identified a putative control element 5' of ces-1 coding sequences. This element contains a site that can be bound by CES-2 protein, suggesting ces-1 may be transcriptionally regulated directly by ces-2. This element also contains five Snail-like binding sites, suggesting ces-1 may regulate its own transcription. These results suggest that programmed cell death, like many cell fates, is under transcriptional control, and that a transcriptional cascade control the deaths of at least some cells in C. elegans. We propose that some of the ced genes, which are involved in the execution of programmed cell death in C.elegans, are transcriptionally regulated by CES-1 and/or CES-2. Additionally, both ces-1 and ces-2 have homologues which might function in regulating programmed cell death in mammalian cells, suggesting the functions of ces-1 and ces-2 may be evolutionarily conserved.",

Few devices exist that are capable of passive, repeatable nanoscale fixturing; this research facilitates the design of such devices by providing a more complete understanding of how flexural elements affect their performance. Improvements in coupling technology are expected to decrease production and assembly costs in a variety of industries where repeatable fixturing is required (e.g. the semiconductor, automotive, and tooling and machinery industries), and have the potential to improve the quality of research in a wide range of fields by increasing the speed and accuracy of manufacturing processes and metrology systems. Flexures serve to improve the performance of ball-and-flat contacts by preventing motion of the flats in the direction perpendicular to the contacts while allowing motion in tangential directions, thus reducing the effects of friction and wear at the interface. Flexural elements have been used to reduce hysteresis and prevent overconstraint in kinematic couplings but the use of planar flexures as friction and wear reducing devices has not been previously studied.(cont.) A kinematic coupling that uses planar flexures was designed, constructed and tested. This coupling showed similar repeatability to a rigid coupling used as a control when the ball-and-flat contacts of both were free of wear; however, the flexure-based coupling performed much better than the control coupling after the contacts had been roughened by material failures resulting from repeated loading.",

The goal is to adapt this test stand so that it could be used to test a reciprocating compressor in this region. A control program is written to maintain a constant saturated suction temperature, suction temperature, and saturated discharge temperature. The program was able to maintain control with errors of ±0.2 °C at most points. At each test point, refrigerant mass flow rate, compressor input power, and discharge temperature is monitored. The amount of heat removed by the condenser was within 7% of the compressor input power and the inverter efficiency was within 5% of the compressor input power for all test points. The inverter efficiency is lowest at low speed. The isentropic efficiency is found to drop off significantly for low pressure ratios. A similar drop off is not expected for reciprocating compressors, so a model for reciprocating compressors is developed. The model is able to predict refrigerant mass flow rate and compressor input power as a function of shaft speed as well as suction and discharge pressures and temperatures. The model is able to accurately predict the mass flow rate with an RMS error within 0.5% and for the power model, the RMS errors are within 3.6%. The mass flow model is found to perform well when extrapolated into lower speed ranges with RMS errors remaining below 0.5%.",

        "Abstrak": "Natural materials and structures have evolved over millions of years to perform very complex and specific biomechanical functions, and as a result can provide insight into optimal designs for particular properties. Mussel byssal threads, the attachment appendage of aquatic mus-sels, are one example of such structures. These threads protrude from the mussel, connecting the mussel to rocks and other hard surfaces, providing a strong and resilient, yet dissipative attachment (so that the mussel can remain attached to the rocks without being dashed against them during violent wave periods). The threads themselves are graded, with both the geometry (cross-section) and the mechanical properties transitioning from the proximal (proximal to the mussel) thread section, which is compliant and highly dissipative, to the distal thread section, which is stiff (relative to the proximal section) and less dissipative at low strains, but more dissipative at high strains. The goal of this thesis is to develop an understanding of the mechanical properties of the individual thread sections during the large stretches seen during its function, as well as to develop a microstructurally-informed constitutive model that captures the microstructural evolution of these materials with loading (an evolution that is dominated by protein unfolding). These material models will then be incorporated into three dimensional finite element model of the thread, in order to gain insight into the design of graded structures.(cont.) The constitutive model developed and outlined herein provides a method for modeling protein unfolding caused by mechanical loading, and captures the major characteristics of the mechanical behavior of these threads. The 3-D finite element model presented and discussed provides insight into design parameters for building graded structures.",

        "Abstrak": "Total landed cost and supply chain risk analysis are methods that many companies use to assess strategic sourcing decisions. For this project, landed cost is defined as those costs associated with material movement from a supplier to a designated PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI) manufacturing site. Tools or models that are available in the technology marketplace are often too cumbersome to incorporate with a company's existing technology architecture or are too simplistic to compute an accurate landed cost. For PerkinElmer, as their Analytical Sciences business continues to grow globally, they are continuously reviewing their supplier portfolio and assessing their procurement strategy. The landed cost and risk analysis tool consists of two components, a cost model and a risk analysis model. Both models were developed to allow PKI to better understand the savings opportunities associated with a supplier selection. When performing supply chain modeling and cost optimization, it was necessary to be able to evaluate multiple scenarios that can influence a sourcing decision. Therefore, by changing parameters such as transportation mode, lead time, inventory carrying cost, freight cost, order frequency, and order quantities in the dynamic cost model, PKI is able to understand supply chain cost trade-offs. The model developed for this project is dynamic to allow multi-variable scenarios to be assessed simultaneously, thus increasing the overall analysis efficiency. For the risk analysis model, approximately 20 different factors were considered as a part of a risk portfolio. This concept adapts traditional financial investment portfolio management theory by considering how much operational impact one factor may have on PKI.(cont.) The concept is to consider a diversified portfolio, so all of the possible risk incurred by a sourcing decision does not reside in any one \"category\" (logistics, inventory, etc.). The outcome of the model is an index and adjusted cost, providing PKI with an estimate of the potential cost of doing business with a supplier based on their risk profile.",

A series of experiments investigated the thermal and perceptual effects of different contact conditions including contact force, contact duration, the object's surface temperature, and its surface roughness. The thermal response of the finger pad was measured using an infrared camera as the contact force varied from 0.1 to 6 N. It was determined that the decrease in skin temperature was highly dependent on the magnitude of contact force as well as contact duration. A second set of experiments investigated the effect of surface texture on the thermal response of the finger pad, and demonstrated, contrary to predictions, that a greater change in skin temperature occurs when the finger is in contact with rougher surfaces. The effect of varying surface texture on the perception of temperature was also investigated. The changes in temperature due to varying surface texture are perceptible, and demonstrate that the perception of surface roughness is not only influenced by changes in temperature, but in turn affects the perception of temperature. The final set of experiments examined the effect of varying the surface temperature of the thermal display on the perceived magnitude of finger force. Over the range of 20 to 38 'C, the surface temperature of the display did not have a significant effect on the perceived magnitude of force. The results of these experiments can be incorporated into thermal models that are used to create more realistic displays for virtual environments and teleoperated systems.",

After September 11, 2001, critical infrastructure protection has become a national focus in the United States and is likely to remain one for the foreseeable future. Damage to the infrastructures and assets could be mitigated through pre-disaster planning and actions. A systematic method has been developed to assess and rank the risks from these multiple hazards in a small community of 20,000 people. It is an interdisciplinary study that includes probabilistic risk assessment, decision analysis, and expert judgment. Scenarios are constructed to show how the initiating events evolve into undesirable consequences. A value tree, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is used to capture the decision maker's preferences about the impacts on the infrastructures and other assets. The risks from random failures are ranked according to their Expected Performance Index values, which is the product of frequency, probability, and consequence of a scenario. Risks from malicious acts are ranked according to their Performance Index values as the frequency of attack is not available. A deliberative process is used to capture the factors that could not be addressed in the analysis and to scrutinize the results. This method provides a framework for the development of a risk-informed decision strategy. Although this study uses the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus as a test-bed, it is a general methodology that could be used by other similar communities and municipalities.",

        "Abstrak": "In many real world systems, two types of uncertainties exist: those that evolve in small, continuous increments and those that may create large, discrete changes in the system. The field of engineering real options posits that flexible system designs can improve system performance in the face of such uncertainties. However, up to now, most analyses of engineering real options deal with one type of uncertainty at a time. One common analysis method for the incremental uncertainty is done by using binomial lattices, while the discrete changes are typically analyzed using traditional decision analysis. This thesis develops a new hybrid method which combines the lattice and decision analyses for the evaluation of real options. This method makes it possible to account for and display both types of uncertainties at the same time while drawing on the strengths of the two traditional methods. The main advantage is that decision makers are able to compare distributions resulting from strategies rather than only comparing single value evaluations such as expected net present value. The description of the distributions is made via Value at Risk and Gain (VARG) graphs. Also, risk preferences of decision makers are considered directly, rather than by the use of artificial utility functions or by evading the issue entirely. The main disadvantage of the method is that its complexity grows exponentially if many time periods, decision, and chance events are introduced. Therefore, the procedure is outlined for two stages of analysis step by step, and it has been programmed in Excel. To illustrate the method, an application to a supply chain strategy is developed for a computer wholesale company. The situation facing the company is whether to set up a local distribution mode (LDM) in a region experiencing increasing demand.(cont.) The competition may also decide to establish local distribution in the region. In this light, the incremental uncertainty is the growth of demand while the discrete uncertainty is the competition's decision to enter the market locally.",

Here, we present a novel model and stochastic kinetics for an intracellular network interacting with hidden cell environments, employing a complete description of cell state dynamics and its coupling to the system network. Our analysis reveals that various environmental effects on the product number fluctuation of intracellular reaction networks can be collectively characterized by Laplace transform of the time-correlation function of the product creation rate fluctuation with the Laplace variable being the product decay rate. On the basis of the latter result, we propose an efficient method for quantitative analysis of the chemical fluctuation produced by intracellular networks coupled to hidden cell environments. By applying the present approach to the gene expression network, we obtain simple analytic results for the gene expression variability and the environment-induced correlations between the expression levels of mutually noninteracting genes. The theoretical results compose a unified framework for quantitative understanding of various gene expression statistics observed across a number of different systems with a small number of adjustable parameters with clear physical meanings.",

The purpose of the analysis is three fold: (1) to identify the bottleneck processes where the capacities fall short of demand; (2) to generate the optimal stock building policy that minimizes the inventory holding cost; (3) to derive a cost-efficient executable production plan with consideration of the operating labor cost. The strategy outlined can be applied easily in actual manufacturing. This efficient and robust model can be used to obtain optimal stock building policy with various demand and capacity scenarios.

Multiple distinct complexes regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein (GAP), and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Arginine stimulation of cells activates mTORC1, but how it is sensed is not well understood. Recently, SLC38A9 was identified as a putative lysosomal arginine sensor required for arginine to activate mTORC1 but how arginine deprivation represses mTORC1 is unknown. Here, we show that CASTOR1, a previously uncharacterized protein, interacts with GATOR2 and is required for arginine deprivation to inhibit mTORC1. CASTOR1 homodimerizes and can also heterodimerize with the related protein, CASTOR2. Arginine disrupts the CASTOR1-GATOR2 complex by binding to CASTOR1 with a dissociation constant of ∼30 μM, and its arginine-binding capacity is required for arginine to activate mTORC1 in cells. Collectively, these results establish CASTOR1 as an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",

A regulatory N domain functions to control the activity of the enzyme and binding to its partner peptidase, the 20S proteasome. In this thesis I present experiments which investigate the role of inter-ring communication in ATP hydrolysis, protein unfolding, and allosteric interactions with the 20S and show how these features affect enzyme function. Experiments also show how the N domain controls D1-D2 interactions that govern ATP hydrolysis and substrate unfolding. Finally, I present experiments that take steps toward developing a system for screening protein substrates of Cdc48-20S and identify several substrates from E. coli lysates.",

Using the design parameters determined by the mathematical model, a solid model was generated and an ANSYS goal-driven optimizer was used to further optimize the hull weldment and variable ballast tanks. When three different designs were subsequently evaluated to verify the parametric model and the scalability of the NPMS design concept, all three were found to be able to be successfully generated and to meet the stated design requirements after ANSYS optimization. These findings indicate that the approach presented in this thesis can be used as an initial design tool in the future design of NPMSs.",

In contrast to previous accounts, the need for phonological operations is drastically reduced, being restricted to sentences containing only a verb (in which prosodic inversion applies as a last resort). In the course of investigating the role of clitics with respect to argument structure and syntactic derivation, several novel phenomena are uncovered that do not exist in better studied languages. Some of the features scrutinized include compound verbs, agreement, aspect, ergativity, word order (scrambling), possessor raising and dislocation, ambiguity, relative clauses, and overt vs. covert movement.",

Using infrared and Chandra X-ray Doppler velocity measurements, along with the locations of optical ejecta beyond the forward shock, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the remnant. The structure of Cas A can be characterized into a spherical component, a tilted thick disk, and multiple ejecta jets/pistons and optical fast-moving knots all populating the thick disk plane. The Bright Ring in Cas A identifies the intersection between the thick plane/pistons and a roughly spherical reverse shock. The ejecta pistons indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion. Some ejecta pistons are bipolar with oppositely directed flows about the expansion center while some ejecta pistons show no such symmetry. Some ejecta pistons appear to maintain the integrity of the nuclear burning layers while others appear to have punched through the outer layers. The ejecta pistons indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion. In three dimensions, the Fe jet in the southeast occupies a \"hole\" in the Si-group emission and does not represent \"overturning,\" as previously thought. Although interaction with the circumstellar medium affects the detailed appearance of the remnant and may affect the visibility of the southeast Fe jet, the bulk of the symmetries and asymmetries in Cas A are intrinsic to the explosion.",

        "Abstrak": "Landscapes are expected to evolve differently under the influence of different climate conditions. However, the relationship between landscape evolution and climate is not well understood. I investigate the relationship between landscape evolution and climate by using natural experiments in which climate varies with slope aspect (geographic orientation) and causes differences in landscape form, such as steeper equator- or pole-facing slopes. In order to understand which mechanisms are responsible for the development of this topographic asymmetry, I adapted a numerical landscape evolution model to include different asymmetry-forming mechanisms such as aspect-induced variations in soil creep intensity, regolith strength, and runoff, and also lateral channel migration. Numerical experiments reveal topographic signatures associated with each of these mechanisms that can be compared with field sites that exhibit asymmetry. I used these numerical model results, along with estimates of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil strength, evidence of stream capture and channel beheadings, and erosion rates determined from cosmogenic radionuclides to determine which asymmetry forming mechanisms are likely responsible for the topographic asymmetry at Gabilan Mesa, a landscape in the central California Coast Ranges. I find that aspect-dependent differences in runoff are most likely responsible for the bulk of the asymmetry at Gabilan Mesa, but lateral channel migration has contributed to the asymmetry in some locations. To further investigate climate's influence on landscape evolution, I compiled new and previously published estimates of slope-dependent soil transport efficiency across a range of climates. I find that soil transport efficiency increases with mean annual precipitation and the aridity index, a measure that describes water availability for plants. I also find that soil transport efficiency varies with lithology and that different measurement techniques can bias estimates of the soil transport coefficient.",

        "Abstrak": "This work has focused on evaluating the thermo-mechanical performance of two innovative nuclear fuel designs: the ThO2-based resource-renewable boiling water reactor (RBWR) and silicon carbide (SiC) cladding in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). Since these designs employ non-traditional fuel rod materials and/or operating conditions, the fuel behavior and limits lie outside of current experience and must be appropriately assessed. The RedTail fuel performance code was developed to support early-stage innovative fuel designs using established models within a modular code structure. Additionally, the applied assumptions have been selected to allow for fast run times. This versatility and speed allow the RedTail fuel performance code to be applied towards broad scoping studies of new fuel rod concepts. With its use of (ThUPu)O2 and high cladding fluence, new physical models were applied to describe the ThO2-based RBWR fuel rods. The effects of lattice strain induced phonon scattering and semi-conductive electron transport on the thermal conductivity for this ternary fuel mixture were modeled. A new model has also been created to reconstruct the radial distribution of the fission rate in the fuel. Lastly, the effects of high fast neutron fluence on the accelerated oxidation and hydrogen pickup by Zircaloy-2 have been investigated and incorporated. In developing the ThO2-based RBWR concept, three designs have been proposed based on different goals and applied assumptions. With the exception of hydrogen uptake, none of the predicted parameters exceeded their limitations. However, the application of hydrogen-based cladding accident limits was found to be restricting. A sensitivity study revealed that in order to retain non-zero accident limits, an advanced cladding is required. Because of its lower corrosion rate and high strength in high temperature steam, composite ceramic SiC cladding has the potential to improve the response to severe accidents. Applicable SiC material properties have been investigated, and new swelling and thermal conductivity models have been applied to treat radiation damage effects. In addition, Weibull failure mechanics are applied to CVD SiC. The fuel performance of every SiC clad pin in a PWR core has been evaluated to find the core-wide leaker risk. To account for uncertainty in potential SiC cladding designs 24 separate cases were evaluated along with a comparison to ZIRLO®. The three-layer SiC architecture is found not to be a viable option due to large shutdown stresses. The two-layer design, however, shows much lower failure risk. This study indicates that significant opportunities exist to optimize core design to improve SiC cladding performance.",

With the enhanced accuracy, we quantify the mass of chromosomes in intact living cells, and differentiate two human colon cancer lines, HT-29 and T84 cells, solely based on the non-aqueous (dry) mass of chromosomes. In addition, we demonstrate chromosomal imaging using a dual-wavelength RTPM, which shows its potential to determine the molecular composition of cellular organelles in live cells.",

        "Abstrak": "Model-based light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) seemed a promising technique for in-vivo diagnosis of dysplasia in multiple organs. In the studies, the residual spectrum, the difference between the observed and modeled diffuse reflectance spectra, was attributed to single elastic light scattering from epithelial nuclei, and diagnostic information due to nuclear changes was extracted from it. We show that this picture is incorrect. The actual single scattering signal arising from epithelial nuclei is much smaller than the previously computed residual spectrum, and does not have the wavelength dependence characteristic of Mie scattering. Rather, the residual spectrum largely arises from assuming a uniform hemoglobin distribution. In fact, hemoglobin is packaged in blood vessels, which alters the reflectance. When we include vessel packaging, which accounts for an inhomogeneous hemoglobin distribution, in the diffuse reflectance model,  the reflectance is modeled more accurately, greatly reducing the amplitude of the residual spectrum. These findings are verified via numerical estimates based on light propagation and Mie theory, tissue phantom experiments, and analysis of published data measured from Barrett's esophagus. In future studies, vessel packaging should be included in the model of diffuse reflectance and use of model-based LSS should be discontinued.",

        "Abstrak": "Two novel ways of engineering the filamentous bacteriophage, M13, for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease are proposed. Both ways are founded on the unique structural properties of the M13 bacteriophage and the ability of its major and minor coat proteins, p3 and p8, to be manipulated to serve as virus-based multifunctional platforms. The first project addresses the problem of vaccine storage and the cold chain (requirement to store vaccines at 2-80C or lower). The need for refrigeration leads to high cost, difficult field delivery, and high potential for vaccine instability. By capitalizing on the liquid crystalline nature and unique diffraction patterns of phage films, we aim to encapsulate vaccines in a 3-D liquid crystalline matrix that would not only allow for stability at elevated temperatures but would also allow for easy detection of viability by using a laser light and noting the diffraction pattern. We chose luciferase as a model for a protein-based vaccine, and found several phage-borne peptide sequences with increased affinity to luciferase compared to controls. Two of these sequences, CKLHGTSRC and CTHKNQAC were chosen to form luciferase-encapsulated phage films. The second project addresses the need of more sensitive imaging techniques for early detection of cancer.(cont.) M13 bacteriophage were used in combination with quantum dots and magnetic nanoparticles as bigger and brighter markers for cancer lesions. A 100% expressed p8 library was created for screening against potential cancer markers and work will soon proceed with screening against several cancer cell lines. In addition, a Type 83 phage was created that had a sequence directed against vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressed on the p3 and a tri-glutamate sequence (E3) on the p8 that could bind well to positively charge molecules like amines. Successful attachment of amine-terminated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots to p8E3 phage (E3 on p8 and wildtype on p3) was shown and III-V quantum dots (GaN and InN) were water solubilized for use in vivo. The goal is to combine all parts and start in vivo testing and screening, as well as to expand our cancer targeting repertoire.",
